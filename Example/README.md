# Terminal.Gui C# Example

This example shows how to use the Terminal.Gui library to create a simple GUI application in C#.

This is the same code found in the Terminal.Gui README.md file.

To explore the full range of functionality in Terminal.Gui, see the [UICatalog](../UICatalog) project

See [README.md](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui) for a list of all Terminal.Gui samples.

Note, the old `demo.cs` example has been deleted because it was not a very good example. It can still be found in the [git history](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/tree/v1.8.2).
