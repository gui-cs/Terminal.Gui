It is accessible via the MainLoop property. You can hook up to the Iteration event to have your method invoked on each iteration of the MainLoop . When invoked sets the SynchronizationContext to one that is tied to the mainloop, allowing user code to use async/await. Examples // A simple Terminal.Gui app that creates a window with a frame and title with // 5 rows/columns of padding. Application.Init(); var win = new Window (\"Hello World - CTRL-Q to quit\") { X = 5, Y = 5, Width = Dim.Fill (5), Height = Dim.Fill (5) }; Application.Top.Add(win); Application.Run(); Fields Driver The current ConsoleDriver in use.

Declaration public static View WantContinuousButtonPressedView { get; } Property Value Type Description View Methods Begin(Toplevel) Building block API: Prepares the provided Toplevel for execution. Declaration public static Application.RunState Begin(Toplevel toplevel) Parameters Type Name Description Toplevel toplevel Toplevel to prepare execution for. Returns Type Description Application.RunState The runstate handle that needs to be passed to the End(Application.RunState) method upon completion. Remarks This method prepares the provided toplevel for running with the focus, it adds this to the list of toplevels, sets up the mainloop to process the event, lays out the subviews, focuses the first element, and draws the toplevel in the screen. This is usually followed by executing the RunLoop(Application.RunState, Boolean) method, and then the End(Application.RunState) method upon termination which will undo these changes. DoEvents() Wakes up the mainloop that might be waiting on input, must be thread safe. Declaration public static void DoEvents() End(Application.RunState) Building block API: completes the execution of a Toplevel that was started with Begin(Toplevel) . Declaration public static void End(Application.RunState runState) Parameters Type Name Description Application.RunState runState The runstate returned by the Begin(Toplevel) method.

Declaration public static void MovePrevious() Refresh() Triggers a refresh of the entire display. Declaration public static void Refresh() RequestStop(Toplevel) Stops running the most recent Toplevel or the top if provided. Declaration public static void RequestStop(Toplevel top = null) Parameters Type Name Description Toplevel top The toplevel to request stop. Remarks This will cause Run(Func<Exception, Boolean>) to return. Calling RequestStop(Toplevel) is equivalent to setting the Running property on the currently running Toplevel to false. Run(Func<Exception, Boolean>) Runs the application by calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) with the value of Top Declaration public static void Run(Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null) Parameters Type Name Description System.Func < System.Exception , System.Boolean > errorHandler Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) Runs the main loop on the given Toplevel container. Declaration public static void Run(Toplevel view, Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null) Parameters Type Name Description Toplevel view The Toplevel to run modally. System.Func < System.Exception , System.Boolean > errorHandler Handler for any unhandled exceptions (resumes when returns true, rethrows when null). Remarks This method is used to start processing events for the main application, but it is also used to run other modal View s such as Dialog boxes. To make a Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) stop execution, call RequestStop(Toplevel) . Calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) is equivalent to calling Begin(Toplevel) , followed by RunLoop(Application.RunState, Boolean) , and then calling End(Application.RunState) . Alternatively, to have a program control the main loop and process events manually, call Begin(Toplevel) to set things up manually and then repeatedly call RunLoop(Application.RunState, Boolean) with the wait parameter set to false. By doing this the RunLoop(Application.RunState, Boolean) method will only process any pending events, timers, idle handlers and then return control immediately. When errorHandler is null the exception is rethrown, when it returns true the application is resumed and when false method exits gracefully. Run<T>(Func<Exception, Boolean>) Runs the application by calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) with a new instance of the specified Toplevel -derived class Declaration public static void Run<T>(Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null) where T : Toplevel, new() Parameters Type Name Description System.Func < System.Exception , System.Boolean > errorHandler Type Parameters Name Description T RunLoop(Application.RunState, Boolean) Building block API: Runs the main loop for the created dialog Declaration public static void RunLoop(Application.RunState state, bool wait = true) Parameters Type Name Description Application.RunState state The state returned by the Begin method. System.Boolean wait By default this is true which will execute the runloop waiting for events, if you pass false, you can use this method to run a single iteration of the events. Remarks Use the wait parameter to control whether this is a blocking or non-blocking call. RunMainLoopIteration(ref Application.RunState, Boolean, ref Boolean) Run one iteration of the MainLoop. Declaration public static void RunMainLoopIteration(ref Application.RunState state, bool wait, ref bool firstIteration) Parameters Type Name Description Application.RunState state The state returned by the Begin method. System.Boolean wait If will execute the runloop waiting for events. System.Boolean firstIteration If it's the first run loop iteration. Shutdown() Shutdown an application initialized with Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) Declaration public static void Shutdown() UngrabMouse() Releases the mouse grab, so mouse events will be routed to the view on which the mouse is. Declaration public static void UngrabMouse() Events NotifyNewRunState Notify that a new Application.RunState token was created, used if ExitRunLoopAfterFirstIteration is true. Declaration public static event Action<Application.RunState> NotifyNewRunState Event Type Type Description System.Action < Application.RunState > NotifyStopRunState Notify that a existent Application.RunState token is stopping, used if ExitRunLoopAfterFirstIteration is true.

The hotkey is the first letter or digit following the first underscore ('_') in the button text. Use HotKeySpecifier to change the hotkey specifier from the default of ('_'). If no hotkey specifier is found, the first uppercase letter encountered will be used as the hotkey. When the button is configured as the default ( IsDefault ) and the user presses the ENTER key, if no other View processes the KeyEvent , the Button 's System.Action will be invoked. Constructors Button() Initializes a new instance of Button using Computed layout. Declaration public Button() Remarks The width of the Button is computed based on the text length.

Overrides Responder.MouseEvent(MouseEvent) OnClicked() Virtual method to invoke the Clicked event. Declaration public virtual void OnClicked() OnEnter(View) Method invoked when a view gets focus. Declaration public override bool OnEnter(View view) Parameters Type Name Description View view The view that is losing focus. Returns Type Description System.Boolean true , if the event was handled, false otherwise. Overrides View.OnEnter(View) PositionCursor() Positions the cursor in the right position based on the currently focused view in the chain. Declaration public override void PositionCursor() Overrides View.PositionCursor() ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent) This method can be overwritten by views that want to provide accelerator functionality (Alt-key for example), but without interefering with normal ProcessKey behavior. Declaration public override bool ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent kb) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent kb Returns Type Description System.Boolean Overrides View.ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent) Remarks After keys are sent to the subviews on the current view, all the view are processed and the key is passed to the views to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a cold-key. This functionality is used, for example, by default buttons to act on the enter key. Processing this as a hot-key would prevent non-default buttons from consuming the enter keypress when they have the focus. ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent) This method can be overwritten by view that want to provide accelerator functionality (Alt-key for example). Declaration public override bool ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent kb) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent kb Returns Type Description System.Boolean Overrides View.ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Before keys are sent to the subview on the current view, all the views are processed and the key is passed to the widgets to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a hot-key. For example, if you implement a button that has a hotkey ok \"o\", you would catch the combination Alt-o here. If the event is caught, you must return true to stop the keystroke from being dispatched to other views. ProcessKey(KeyEvent) If the view is focused, gives the view a chance to process the keystroke. Declaration public override bool ProcessKey(KeyEvent kb) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent kb Returns Type Description System.Boolean Overrides View.ProcessKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Views can override this method if they are interested in processing the given keystroke. If they consume the keystroke, they must return true to stop the keystroke from being processed by other widgets or consumed by the widget engine. If they return false, the keystroke will be passed using the ProcessColdKey method to other views to process. The View implementation does nothing but return false, so it is not necessary to call base.ProcessKey if you derive directly from View, but you should if you derive other View subclasses. UpdateTextFormatterText() Can be overridden if the Text has different format than the default. Declaration protected override void UpdateTextFormatterText() Overrides View.UpdateTextFormatterText() Events Clicked Clicked System.Action , raised when the user clicks the primary mouse button within the Bounds of this View or if the user presses the action key while this view is focused. (TODO: IsDefault) Declaration public event Action Clicked Event Type Type Description System.Action Remarks Client code can hook up to this event, it is raised when the button is activated either with the mouse or the keyboard.

Users can switch from one side to the other by using the tab key. To enable editing, set AllowEdits to true. When AllowEdits is true the user can make changes to the hexadecimal values of the System.IO.Stream . Any changes are tracked in the Edits property (a System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary`2 ) indicating the position where the changes were made and the new values. A convenience method, ApplyEdits(Stream) will apply the edits to the System.IO.Stream . Control the first byte shown by setting the DisplayStart property to an offset in the stream. Constructors HexView() Initializes a HexView class using Computed layout. Declaration public HexView() HexView(Stream) Initializes a HexView class using Computed layout. Declaration public HexView(Stream source) Parameters Type Name Description System.IO.Stream source The System.IO.Stream to view and edit as hex, this System.IO.Stream must support seeking, or an exception will be thrown. Properties AllowEdits Gets or sets whether this HexView allow editing of the System.IO.Stream of the underlying System.IO.Stream .

Edits Gets a System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary`2 describing the edits done to the HexView . Each Key indicates an offset where an edit was made and the Value is the changed byte. Declaration public IReadOnlyDictionary<long, byte> Edits { get; } Property Value Type Description System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyDictionary < System.Int64 , System.Byte > The edits. Frame Gets or sets the frame for the view. The frame is relative to the view's container ( SuperView ). Declaration public override Rect Frame { get; set; } Property Value Type Description Rect The frame. Overrides View.Frame Remarks Change the Frame when using the Absolute layout style to move or resize views. Altering the Frame of a view will trigger the redrawing of the view as well as the redrawing of the affected regions of the SuperView . Position Gets the current character position starting at one, related to the System.IO.Stream . Declaration public long Position { get; } Property Value Type Description System.Int64 Source Sets or gets the System.IO.Stream the HexView is operating on; the stream must support seeking ( System.IO.Stream.CanSeek == true). Declaration public Stream Source { get; set; } Property Value Type Description System.IO.Stream The source. Methods ApplyEdits(Stream) This method applies and edits made to the System.IO.Stream and resets the contents of the Edits property. Declaration public void ApplyEdits(Stream stream = null) Parameters Type Name Description System.IO.Stream stream If provided also applies the changes to the passed System.IO.Stream DiscardEdits() This method discards the edits made to the System.IO.Stream by resetting the contents of the Edits property. Declaration public void DiscardEdits() MouseEvent(MouseEvent) Method invoked when a mouse event is generated Declaration public override bool MouseEvent(MouseEvent me) Parameters Type Name Description MouseEvent me Returns Type Description System.Boolean true , if the event was handled, false otherwise. Overrides Responder.MouseEvent(MouseEvent) OnEdited(KeyValuePair<Int64, Byte>) Method used to invoke the Edited event passing the System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<, > . Declaration public virtual void OnEdited(KeyValuePair<long, byte> keyValuePair) Parameters Type Name Description System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair < System.Int64 , System.Byte > keyValuePair The key value pair. OnEnter(View) Method invoked when a view gets focus. Declaration public override bool OnEnter(View view) Parameters Type Name Description View view The view that is losing focus. Returns Type Description System.Boolean true , if the event was handled, false otherwise. Overrides View.OnEnter(View) OnPositionChanged() Method used to invoke the PositionChanged event passing the HexView.HexViewEventArgs arguments. Declaration public virtual void OnPositionChanged() PositionCursor() Positions the cursor in the right position based on the currently focused view in the chain. Declaration public override void PositionCursor() Overrides View.PositionCursor() ProcessKey(KeyEvent) If the view is focused, gives the view a chance to process the keystroke. Declaration public override bool ProcessKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Contains the details about the key that produced the event. Returns Type Description System.Boolean Overrides View.ProcessKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Views can override this method if they are interested in processing the given keystroke. If they consume the keystroke, they must return true to stop the keystroke from being processed by other widgets or consumed by the widget engine. If they return false, the keystroke will be passed using the ProcessColdKey method to other views to process. The View implementation does nothing but return false, so it is not necessary to call base.ProcessKey if you derive directly from View, but you should if you derive other View subclasses. Redraw(Rect) Redraws this view and its subviews; only redraws the views that have been flagged for a re-display. Declaration public override void Redraw(Rect bounds) Parameters Type Name Description Rect bounds The bounds (view-relative region) to redraw. Overrides View.Redraw(Rect) Remarks Always use Bounds (view-relative) when calling Redraw(Rect) , NOT Frame (superview-relative). Views should set the color that they want to use on entry, as otherwise this will inherit the last color that was set globally on the driver. Overrides of Redraw(Rect) must ensure they do not set Driver.Clip to a clip region larger than the region parameter. Events Edited Event to be invoked when an edit is made on the System.IO.Stream . Declaration public event Action<KeyValuePair<long, byte>> Edited Event Type Type Description System.Action < System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair < System.Int64 , System.Byte >> PositionChanged Event to be invoked when the position and cursor position changes.

Items in the can be activated firing an event (with the ENTER key or a mouse double-click). If the AllowsMarking property is true, elements of the list can be marked by the user. By default ListView uses System.Object.ToString to render the items of any System.Collections.IList object (e.g. arrays, System.Collections.Generic.List<> , and other collections). Alternatively, an object that implements the IListDataSource interface can be provided giving full control of what is rendered. ListView can display any object that implements the System.Collections.IList interface. System.String values are converted into NStack.ustring values before rendering, and other values are converted into System.String by calling System.Object.ToString and then converting to NStack.ustring . To change the contents of the ListView, set the Source property (when providing custom rendering via IListDataSource ) or call SetSource(IList) an System.Collections.IList is being used. When AllowsMarking is set to true the rendering will prefix the rendered items with [x] or [ ] and bind the SPACE key to toggle the selection. To implement a different marking style set AllowsMarking to false and implement custom rendering. Constructors ListView() Initializes a new instance of ListView . Set the Source property to display something. Declaration public ListView() ListView(IList) Initializes a new instance of ListView that will display the contents of the object implementing the System.Collections.IList interface, with relative positioning. Declaration public ListView(IList source) Parameters Type Name Description System.Collections.IList source An System.Collections.IList data source, if the elements are strings or ustrings, the string is rendered, otherwise the ToString() method is invoked on the result.

Declaration public virtual bool ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Contains the details about the key that produced the event. Returns Type Description System.Boolean Remarks After keys are sent to the subviews on the current view, all the view are processed and the key is passed to the views to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a cold-key. This functionality is used, for example, by default buttons to act on the enter key. Processing this as a hot-key would prevent non-default buttons from consuming the enter keypress when they have the focus. ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent) This method can be overwritten by view that want to provide accelerator functionality (Alt-key for example). Declaration public virtual bool ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent kb) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent kb Returns Type Description System.Boolean Remarks Before keys are sent to the subview on the current view, all the views are processed and the key is passed to the widgets to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a hot-key. For example, if you implement a button that has a hotkey ok \"o\", you would catch the combination Alt-o here. If the event is caught, you must return true to stop the keystroke from being dispatched to other views. ProcessKey(KeyEvent) If the view is focused, gives the view a chance to process the keystroke. Declaration public virtual bool ProcessKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Contains the details about the key that produced the event. Returns Type Description System.Boolean Remarks Views can override this method if they are interested in processing the given keystroke. If they consume the keystroke, they must return true to stop the keystroke from being processed by other widgets or consumed by the widget engine. If they return false, the keystroke will be passed using the ProcessColdKey method to other views to process. The View implementation does nothing but return false, so it is not necessary to call base.ProcessKey if you derive directly from View, but you should if you derive other View subclasses.

A Toplevel is created when an application initializes Terminal.Gui by calling Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) . The application Toplevel can be accessed via Top . Additional Toplevels can be created and run (e.g. Dialog s. To run a Toplevel, create the Toplevel and call Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, Boolean>) . Toplevels can also opt-in to more sophisticated initialization by implementing System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize . When they do so, the System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize.BeginInit and System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize.EndInit methods will be called before running the view. If first-run-only initialization is preferred, the System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitializeNotification can be implemented too, in which case the System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize methods will only be called if System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitializeNotification.IsInitialized is false .

Views can contain one or more subviews, can respond to user input and render themselves on the screen. Views supports two layout styles: Absolute or Computed. The choice as to which layout style is used by the View is determined when the View is initialized. To create a View using Absolute layout, call a constructor that takes a Rect parameter to specify the absolute position and size (the View. Frame )/. To create a View using Computed layout use a constructor that does not take a Rect parameter and set the X, Y, Width and Height properties on the view. Both approaches use coordinates that are relative to the container they are being added to. To switch between Absolute and Computed layout, use the LayoutStyle property. Computed layout is more flexible and supports dynamic console apps where controls adjust layout as the terminal resizes or other Views change size or position. The X, Y, Width and Height properties are Dim and Pos objects that dynamically update the position of a view. The X and Y properties are of type Pos and you can use either absolute positions, percentages or anchor points. The Width and Height properties are of type Dim and can use absolute position, percentages and anchors. These are useful as they will take care of repositioning views when view's frames are resized or if the terminal size changes. Absolute layout requires specifying coordinates and sizes of Views explicitly, and the View will typically stay in a fixed position and size. To change the position and size use the Frame property. Subviews (child views) can be added to a View by calling the Add(View) method. The container of a View can be accessed with the SuperView property. To flag a region of the View's Bounds to be redrawn call SetNeedsDisplay(Rect) . To flag the entire view for redraw call SetNeedsDisplay() . Views have a ColorScheme property that defines the default colors that subviews should use for rendering. This ensures that the views fit in the context where they are being used, and allows for themes to be plugged in. For example, the default colors for windows and toplevels uses a blue background, while it uses a white background for dialog boxes and a red background for errors. Subclasses should not rely on ColorScheme being set at construction time. If a ColorScheme is not set on a view, the view will inherit the value from its SuperView and the value might only be valid once a view has been added to a SuperView. By using ColorScheme applications will work both in color as well as black and white displays. Views that are focusable should implement the PositionCursor() to make sure that the cursor is placed in a location that makes sense. Unix terminals do not have a way of hiding the cursor, so it can be distracting to have the cursor left at the last focused view. So views should make sure that they place the cursor in a visually sensible place. The LayoutSubviews() method is invoked when the size or layout of a view has changed. The default processing system will keep the size and dimensions for views that use the Absolute , and will recompute the frames for the vies that use Computed . Constructors View() Initializes a new instance of View using Computed layout. Declaration public View() Remarks Use X , Y , Width , and Height properties to dynamically control the size and location of the view. The Label will be created using Computed coordinates. The initial size ( Frame will be adjusted to fit the contents of Text , including newlines ('\\n') for multiple lines. If Height is greater than one, word wrapping is provided.

Properties AutoSize Gets or sets a flag that determines whether the View will be automatically resized to fit the Text . The default is `false`. Set to `true` to turn on AutoSize. If AutoSize is `true` the Width and Height will always be used if the text size is lower. If the text size is higher the bounds will be resized to fit it. In addition, if ForceValidatePosDim is `true` the new values of Width and Height must be of the same types of the existing one to avoid breaking the Dim settings.

By default, Modal is true; launch the Wizard using `Application.Run(wizard)`. Set Modal to `false` to use Wizard as an embedded View, and add the Wizard to a containing view with Add(View) . When used as a modal pop-up window, the Esc key will cause the Cancelled event to fire and (if the event is not cancelled), will cause RequestStop(Toplevel) to be called, closing the Wizard. When used as an embedded View, no frame is drawn around the Wizard. To detect if the user wants to cancel the Wizard, subscrie to the Cancelled event.

If set to `false` the Wizard will have no frame and will behave like any embedded View . Declaration public bool Modal { get; set; } Property Value Type Description System.Boolean NextFinishButton If the CurrentStep is the last step in the wizard, this button causes the Finished event to be fired and the wizard to close. If the step is not the last step, the MovingNext event will be fired and the wizard will move next step. Declaration public Button NextFinishButton { get; } Property Value Type Description Button Remarks Use the MovingNext and Finished events to be notified when the user attempts go to the next step or finish the wizard.

Declaration public override bool ProcessKey(KeyEvent kb) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent kb Returns Type Description System.Boolean Overrides Dialog.ProcessKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Views can override this method if they are interested in processing the given keystroke. If they consume the keystroke, they must return true to stop the keystroke from being processed by other widgets or consumed by the widget engine. If they return false, the keystroke will be passed using the ProcessColdKey method to other views to process. The View implementation does nothing but return false, so it is not necessary to call base.ProcessKey if you derive directly from View, but you should if you derive other View subclasses.

    "keywords": "Keyboard Event Processing Keyboard events are sent by the Main Loop to the Application class for processing. The keyboard events are sent exclusively to the current Toplevel , this being either the default that is created when you call Application.Init , or one that you created an passed to Application.Run(Toplevel) . Flow Keystrokes are first processes as hotkeys, then as regular keys, and there is a final cold post-processing event that is invoked if no view processed the key. HotKey Processing Events are first send to all views as a \"HotKey\", this means that the View.ProcessHotKey method is invoked on the current toplevel, which in turns propagates this to all the views in the hierarchy. If any view decides to process the event, no further processing takes place. This is how hotkeys for buttons are implemented. For example, the keystroke \"Alt-A\" is handled by Buttons that have a hot-letter \"A\" to activate the button. Regular Processing Unlike the hotkey processing, the regular processing is only sent to the currently focused view in the focus chain. The regular key processing is only invoked if no hotkey was caught. Cold-key Processing This stage only is executed if the focused view did not process the event, and is broadcast to all the views in the Toplevel. This method can be overwritten by views that want to provide accelerator functionality (Alt-key for example), but without interfering with normal ProcessKey behavior. Key Bindings Terminal.Gui supports rebinding keys. For example the default key for activating a button is Enter. You can change this using the ClearKeybinding and AddKeybinding methods: var btn = new Button (\"Press Me\"); btn.ClearKeybinding (Command.Accept); btn.AddKeyBinding (Key.b, Command.Accept); The Command enum lists generic operations that are implemented by views. For example Command.Accept in a Button results in the Clicked event firing while in TableView it is bound to CellActivated . Not all commands are implemented by all views (e.g. you cannot scroll in a Button). To see which commands are implemented by a View you can use the GetSupportedCommands() method. Not all controls have the same key bound for a given command, for example Command.Accept defaults to Key.Enter in a Button but defaults to Key.Space in RadioGroup . Global Key Handler Sometimes you may want to define global key handling logic for your entire application that is invoked regardless of what Window/View has focus. This can be achieved by using the Application.RootKeyEvent event."

    "title": "Event Processing and the Application Main Loop",
    "keywords": "Event Processing and the Application Main Loop The method Application.Run that we covered before will wait for events from either the keyboard or mouse and route those events to the proper view. The job of waiting for events and dispatching them in the Application is implemented by an instance of the MainLoop class. Mainloops are a common idiom in many user interface toolkits so many of the concepts will be familiar to you if you have used other toolkits before. This class provides the following capabilities: Keyboard and mouse processing .NET Async support Timers processing Invoking of UI code from a background thread Idle processing handlers Possibility of integration with other mainloops. On Unix systems, it can monitor file descriptors for readability or writability. The MainLoop property in the the Application provides access to these functions. When your code invokes Application.Run (Toplevel) , the application will prepare the current Toplevel instance by redrawing the screen appropriately and then calling the mainloop to run. You can configure the Mainloop before calling Application.Run, or you can configure the MainLoop in response to events during the execution. The keyboard inputs is dispatched by the application class to the current TopLevel window this is covered in more detail in the Keyboard Event Processing document. Async Execution On startup, the Application class configured the .NET Asynchronous machinery to allow you to use the await keyword to run tasks in the background and have the execution of those tasks resume on the context of the main thread running the main loop. Once you invoke Application.Main the async machinery will be ready to use, and you can merely call methods using await from your main thread, and the awaited code will resume execution on the main thread. Timers Processing You can register timers to be executed at specified intervals by calling the AddTimeout method, like this: void UpdateTimer () { time.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString (); } var token = Application.MainLoop.AddTimeout (TimeSpan.FromSeconds (20), UpdateTimer); The return value from AddTimeout is a token value that you can use if you desire to cancel the timer before it runs: Application.MainLoop.RemoveTimeout (token); Idle Handlers You can register code to be executed when the application is idling and there are no events to process by calling the AddIdle method. This method takes as a parameter a function that will be invoked when the application is idling. Idle functions should return true if they should be invoked again, and false if the idle invocations should stop. Like the timer APIs, the return value is a token that can be used to cancel the scheduled idle function from being executed. Threading Like other UI toolkits, Terminal.Gui is generally not thread safe. You should avoid calling methods in the UI classes from a background thread as there is no guarantee that they will not corrupt the state of the UI application. Generally, as there is not much state, you will get lucky, but the application will not behave properly. You will be served better off by using C# async machinery and the various APIs in the System.Threading.Tasks.Task APIs. But if you absolutely must work with threads on your own you should only invoke APIs in Terminal.Gui from the main thread. To make this simple, you can use the Application.MainLoop.Invoke method and pass an Action . This action will be queued for execution on the main thread at an appropriate time and will run your code there. For example, the following shows how to properly update a label from a background thread: void BackgroundThreadUpdateProgress () { Application.MainLoop.Invoke (() => { progress.Text = $\"Progress: {bytesDownloaded/totalBytes}\"; }); } Integration With Other Main Loop Drivers It is possible to run the main loop in a way that it does not take over control of your application, but rather in a cooperative way. To do this, you must use the lower-level APIs in Application : the Begin method to prepare a toplevel for execution, followed by calls to MainLoop.EventsPending to determine whether the events must be processed, and in that case, calling RunLoop method and finally completing the process by calling End . The method Run is implemented like this: void Run (Toplevel top) { var runToken = Begin (view); RunLoop (runToken); End (runToken); } Unix File Descriptor Monitoring On Unix, it is possible to monitor file descriptors for input being available, or for the file descriptor being available for data to be written without blocking the application. To do this, you on Unix, you can cast the MainLoop instance to a UnixMainLoop and use the AddWatch method to register an interest on a particular condition."

    "title": "Terminal.Gui API Overview",
    "keywords": "Terminal.Gui API Overview Terminal.Gui is a library intended to create console-based applications using C#. The framework has been designed to make it easy to write applications that will work on monochrome terminals, as well as modern color terminals with mouse support. This library works across Windows, Linux and MacOS. This library provides a text-based toolkit as works in a way similar to graphic toolkits. There are many controls that can be used to create your applications and it is event based, meaning that you create the user interface, hook up various events and then let the a processing loop run your application, and your code is invoked via one or more callbacks. The simplest application looks like this: using Terminal.Gui; class Demo { static int Main () { Application.Init (); var n = MessageBox.Query (50, 7, \"Question\", \"Do you like console apps?\", \"Yes\", \"No\"); Application.Shutdown (); return n; } } This example shows a prompt and returns an integer value depending on which value was selected by the user (Yes, No, or if they use chose not to make a decision and instead pressed the ESC key). More interesting user interfaces can be created by composing some of the various views that are included. In the following sections, you will see how applications are put together. In the example above, you can see that we have initialized the runtime by calling the Init method in the Application class - this sets up the environment, initializes the color schemes available for your application and clears the screen to start your application. The Application class, additionally creates an instance of the Toplevel class that is ready to be consumed, this instance is available in the Application.Top property, and can be used like this: using Terminal.Gui; class Demo { static int Main () { Application.Init (); var label = new Label (\"Hello World\") { X = Pos.Center (), Y = Pos.Center (), Height = 1, }; Application.Top.Add (label); Application.Run (); Application.Shutdown (); } } Typically, you will want your application to have more than a label, you might want a menu, and a region for your application to live in, the following code does this: using Terminal.Gui; class Demo { static int Main () { Application.Init (); var menu = new MenuBar (new MenuBarItem [] { new MenuBarItem (\"_File\", new MenuItem [] { new MenuItem (\"_Quit\", \"\", () => { Application.RequestStop (); }) }), }); var win = new Window (\"Hello\") { X = 0, Y = 1, Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = Dim.Fill () - 1 }; // Add both menu and win in a single call Application.Top.Add (menu, win); Application.Run (); Application.Shutdown (); } } Views All visible elements on a Terminal.Gui application are implemented as Views . Views are self-contained objects that take care of displaying themselves, can receive keyboard and mouse input and participate in the focus mechanism. See the full list of Views provided by the Terminal.Gui library here . Every view can contain an arbitrary number of children views. These are called the Subviews. You can add a view to an existing view, by calling the Add method, for example, to add a couple of buttons to a UI, you can do this: void SetupMyView (View myView) { var label = new Label (\"Username: \") { X = 1, Y = 1, Width = 20, Height = 1 }; myView.Add (label); var username = new TextField (\"\") { X = 1, Y = 2, Width = 30, Height = 1 }; myView.Add (username); } The container of a given view is called the SuperView and it is a property of every View. Layout Terminal.Gui supports two different layout systems, absolute and computed \\ (controlled by the LayoutStyle property on the view. The absolute system is used when you want the view to be positioned exactly in one location and want to manually control where the view is. This is done by invoking your View constructor with an argument of type Rect . When you do this, to change the position of the View, you can change the Frame property on the View. The computed layout system offers a few additional capabilities, like automatic centering, expanding of dimensions and a handful of other features. To use this you construct your object without an initial Frame , but set the X , Y , Width and Height properties after the object has been created. Examples: // Dynamically computed var label = new Label (\"Hello\") { X = 1, Y = Pos.Center (), Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = 1 }; // Absolute position using the provided rectangle var label2 = new Label (new Rect (1, 2, 20, 1), \"World\") The computed layout system does not take integers, instead the X and Y properties are of type Pos and the Width and Height properties are of type Dim both which can be created implicitly from integer values. The Pos Type The Pos type on X and Y offers a few options: Absolute position, by passing an integer Percentage of the parent's view size - Pos.Percent(n) Anchored from the end of the dimension - AnchorEnd(int margin=0) Centered, using Center() Reference the Left (X), Top (Y), Bottom, Right positions of another view The Pos values can be added or subtracted, like this: // Set the X coordinate to 10 characters left from the center view.X = Pos.Center () - 10; view.Y = Pos.Percent (20); anotherView.X = AnchorEnd (10); anotherView.Width = 9; myView.X = Pos.X (view); myView.Y = Pos.Bottom (anotherView); The Dim Type The Dim type is used for the Width and Height properties on the View and offers the following options: Absolute size, by passing an integer Percentage of the parent's view size - Dim.Percent(n) Fill to the end - Dim.Fill () Reference the Width or Height of another view Like, Pos , objects of type Dim can be added an subtracted, like this: // Set the Width to be 10 characters less than filling // the remaining portion of the screen view.Width = Dim.Fill () - 10; view.Height = Dim.Percent(20) - 1; anotherView.Height = Dim.Height (view)+1 TopLevels, Windows and Dialogs. Among the many kinds of views, you typically will create a Toplevel view (or any of its subclasses, like Window or Dialog which is special kind of views that can be executed modally - that is, the view can take over all input and returns only when the user chooses to complete their work there. The following sections cover the differences. TopLevel Views Toplevel views have no visible user interface elements and occupy an arbitrary portion of the screen. You would use a toplevel Modal view for example to launch an entire new experience in your application, one where you would have a new top-level menu for example. You typically would add a Menu and a Window to your Toplevel, it would look like this: using Terminal.Gui; class Demo { static void Edit (string filename) { var top = new Toplevel () { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = Dim.Fill () }; var menu = new MenuBar (new MenuBarItem [] { new MenuBarItem (\"_File\", new MenuItem [] { new MenuItem (\"_Close\", \"\", () => { Application.RequestStop (); }) }), }); // nest a window for the editor var win = new Window (filename) { X = 0, Y = 1, Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = Dim.Fill () - 1 }; var editor = new TextView () { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = Dim.Fill () }; editor.Text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText (filename); win.Add (editor); // Add both menu and win in a single call top.Add (win, menu); Application.Run (top); Application.Shutdown (); } } Window Views Window views extend the Toplevel view by providing a frame and a title around the toplevel - and can be moved on the screen with the mouse (caveat: code is currently disabled) From a user interface perspective, you might have more than one Window on the screen at a given time. Dialogs Dialog are Window objects that happen to be centered in the middle of the screen. Dialogs are instances of a Window that are centered in the screen, and are intended to be used modally - that is, they run, and they are expected to return a result before resuming execution of your application. Dialogs are a subclass of Window and additionally expose the AddButton API which manages the layout of any button passed to it, ensuring that the buttons are at the bottom of the dialog. Example: bool okpressed = false; var ok = new Button(\"Ok\"); var cancel = new Button(\"Cancel\"); var dialog = new Dialog (\"Quit\", 60, 7, ok, cancel); Which will show something like this: +- Quit -----------------------------------------------+ | | | | | [ Ok ] [ Cancel ] | +------------------------------------------------------+ Running Modally To run your Dialog, Window or Toplevel modally, you will invoke the Application.Run method on the toplevel. It is up to your code and event handlers to invoke the Application.RequestStop() method to terminate the modal execution. bool okpressed = false; var ok = new Button(3, 14, \"Ok\") { Clicked = () => { Application.RequestStop (); okpressed = true; } }; var cancel = new Button(10, 14, \"Cancel\") { Clicked = () => Application.RequestStop () }; var dialog = new Dialog (\"Login\", 60, 18, ok, cancel); var entry = new TextField () { X = 1, Y = 1, Width = Dim.Fill (), Height = 1 }; dialog.Add (entry); Application.Run (dialog); if (okpressed) Console.WriteLine (\"The user entered: \" + entry.Text); There is no return value from running modally, so your code will need to have a mechanism of indicating the reason that the execution of the modal dialog was completed, in the case above, the okpressed value is set to true if the user pressed or selected the Ok button. Input Handling Every view has a focused view, and if that view has nested views, one of those is the focused view. This is called the focus chain, and at any given time, only one View has the focus. The library binds the key Tab to focus the next logical view, and the Shift-Tab combination to focus the previous logical view. Keyboard processing is divided in three stages: HotKey processing, regular processing and cold key processing. Hot key processing happens first, and it gives all the views in the current toplevel a chance to monitor whether the key needs to be treated specially. This for example handles the scenarios where the user pressed Alt-o, and a view with a highlighted \"o\" is being displayed. If no view processed the hotkey, then the key is sent to the currently focused view. If the key was not processed by the normal processing, all views are given a chance to process the keystroke in their cold processing stage. Examples include the processing of the \"return\" key in a dialog when a button in the dialog has been flagged as the \"default\" action. The most common case is the normal processing, which sends the keystrokes to the currently focused view. Mouse events are processed in visual order, and the event will be sent to the view on the screen. The only exception is that no mouse events are delivered to background views when a modal view is running. More details are available on the Keyboard Event Processing document. Colors and Color Schemes All views have been configured with a color scheme that will work both in color terminals as well as the more limited black and white terminals. The various styles are captured in the Colors class which defined color schemes for the toplevel, the normal views, the menu bar, popup dialog boxes and error dialog boxes, that you can use like this: Colors.Toplevel Colors.Base Colors.Menu Colors.Dialog Colors.Error You can use them for example like this to set the colors for a new Window: var w = new Window (\"Hello\"); w.ColorScheme = Colors.Error The ColorScheme represents four values, the color used for Normal text, the color used for normal text when a view is focused an the colors for the hot-keys both in focused and unfocused modes. By using ColorSchemes you ensure that your application will work correctbly both in color and black and white terminals. Some views support setting individual color attributes, you create an attribute for a particular pair of Foreground/Background like this: var myColor = Application.Driver.MakeAttribute (Color.Blue, Color.Red); var label = new Label (...); label.TextColor = myColor MainLoop, Threads and Input Handling Detailed description of the mainloop is described on the Event Processing and the Application Main Loop document."

    "keywords": "Table View This control supports viewing and editing tabular data. It provides a view of a System.DataTable . System.DataTable is a core class of .net standard and can be created very easily TableView API Reference Csv Example You can create a DataTable from a CSV file by creating a new instance and adding columns and rows as you read them. For a robust solution however you might want to look into a CSV parser library that deals with escaping, multi line rows etc. var dt = new DataTable(); var lines = File.ReadAllLines(filename); foreach(var h in lines[0].Split(',')){ dt.Columns.Add(h); } foreach(var line in lines.Skip(1)) { dt.Rows.Add(line.Split(',')); } Database Example All Ado.net database providers (Oracle, MySql, SqlServer etc) support reading data as DataTables for example: var dt = new DataTable(); using(var con = new SqlConnection(\"Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Trusted_Connection=True;\")) { con.Open(); var cmd = new SqlCommand(\"select * from myTable;\",con); var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd); adapter.Fill(dt); } Displaying the table Once you have set up your data table set it in the view: tableView = new TableView () { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = 50, Height = 10, }; tableView.Table = yourDataTable; Table Rendering TableView supports any size of table (limited only by the RAM requirements of System.DataTable ). You can have thousands of columns and/or millions of rows if you want. Horizontal and vertical scrolling can be done using the mouse or keyboard. TableView uses ColumnOffset and RowOffset to determine the first visible cell of the System.DataTable . Rendering then continues until the avaialble console space is exhausted. Updating the ColumnOffset and RowOffset changes which part of the table is rendered (scrolls the viewport). This approach ensures that no matter how big the table, only a small number of columns/rows need to be evaluated for rendering."

    "title": "Tree View",
    "keywords": "Tree View TreeView is a control for navigating hierarchical objects. It comes in two forms TreeView and TreeView<T> . TreeView API Reference Using TreeView The basic non generic TreeView class is populated by ITreeNode objects. The simplest tree you can make would look something like: var tree = new TreeView() { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = 40, Height = 20 }; var root1 = new TreeNode(\"Root1\"); root1.Children.Add(new TreeNode(\"Child1.1\")); root1.Children.Add(new TreeNode(\"Child1.2\")); var root2 = new TreeNode(\"Root2\"); root2.Children.Add(new TreeNode(\"Child2.1\")); root2.Children.Add(new TreeNode(\"Child2.2\")); tree.AddObject(root1); tree.AddObject(root2); Having to create a bunch of TreeNode objects can be a pain especially if you already have your own objects e.g. House , Room etc. There are two ways to use your own classes without having to create nodes manually. Firstly you can implement the ITreeNode interface: // Your data class private class House : TreeNode { // Your properties public string Address {get;set;} public List<Room> Rooms {get;set;} // ITreeNode member: public override IList<ITreeNode> Children => Rooms.Cast<ITreeNode>().ToList(); public override string Text { get => Address; set => Address = value; } } // Your other data class private class Room : TreeNode{ public string Name {get;set;} public override string Text{get=>Name;set{Name=value;}} } After implementing the interface you can add your objects directly to the tree var myHouse = new House() { Address = \"23 Nowhere Street\", Rooms = new List<Room>{ new Room(){Name = \"Ballroom\"}, new Room(){Name = \"Bedroom 1\"}, new Room(){Name = \"Bedroom 2\"} } }; var tree = new TreeView() { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = 40, Height = 20 }; tree.AddObject(myHouse); Alternatively you can simply tell the tree how the objects relate to one another by implementing ITreeBuilder<T> . This is a good option if you don't have control of the data objects you are working with. TreeView<T> The generic Treeview<T> allows you to store any object hierarchy where nodes implement Type T. For example if you are working with DirectoryInfo and FileInfo objects then you could create a TreeView<FileSystemInfo> . If you don't have a shared interface/base class for all nodes you can still declare a TreeView<object> . In order to use TreeView<T> you need to tell the tree how objects relate to one another (who are children of who). To do this you must provide an ITreeBuilder<T> . Implementing ITreeBuilder<T> Consider a simple data model that already exists in your program: private abstract class GameObject { } private class Army : GameObject { public string Designation {get;set;} public List<Unit> Units {get;set;} public override string ToString () { return Designation; } } private class Unit : GameObject { public string Name {get;set;} public override string ToString () { return Name; } } An ITreeBuilder<T> for these classes might look like: private class GameObjectTreeBuilder : ITreeBuilder<GameObject> { public bool SupportsCanExpand => true; public bool CanExpand (GameObject model) { return model is Army; } public IEnumerable<GameObject> GetChildren (GameObject model) { if(model is Army a) return a.Units; return Enumerable.Empty<GameObject>(); } } To use the builder in a tree you would use: var army1 = new Army() { Designation = \"3rd Infantry\", Units = new List<Unit>{ new Unit(){Name = \"Orc\"}, new Unit(){Name = \"Troll\"}, new Unit(){Name = \"Goblin\"}, } }; var tree = new TreeView<GameObject>() { X = 0, Y = 0, Width = 40, Height = 20, TreeBuilder = new GameObjectTreeBuilder() }; tree.AddObject(army1); Alternatively you can use DelegateTreeBuilder<T> instead of implementing your own ITreeBuilder<T> . For example: tree.TreeBuilder = new DelegateTreeBuilder<GameObject>( (o)=>o is Army a ? a.Units : Enumerable.Empty<GameObject>()); Node Text and ToString The default behavior of TreeView is to use the ToString method on the objects for rendering. You can customise this by changing the AspectGetter . For example: treeViewFiles.AspectGetter = (f)=>f.FullName;"
