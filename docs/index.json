Returns Type Description Application.RunState The Application.RunState handle that needs to be passed to the End(RunState) method upon completion. Remarks This method prepares the provided toplevel for running with the focus, it adds this to the list of toplevels, sets up the mainloop to process the event, lays out the subviews, focuses the first element, and draws the toplevel in the screen. This is usually followed by executing the RunLoop(RunState, bool) method, and then the End(RunState) method upon termination which will undo these changes. | Edit this page View Source DoEvents() Wakes up the mainloop that might be waiting on input, must be thread safe.

Declaration public static void RequestStop(Toplevel top = null) Parameters Type Name Description Toplevel top The toplevel to request stop. Remarks This will cause Run(Func<Exception, bool>) to return. Calling RequestStop(Toplevel) is equivalent to setting the Running property on the currently running Toplevel to false. | Edit this page View Source Run(Func<Exception, bool>) Runs the application by calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) with the value of Top. Declaration public static void Run(Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null) Parameters Type Name Description Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler Remarks See Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) for more details. | Edit this page View Source Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) Runs the main loop on the given Toplevel container. Declaration public static void Run(Toplevel view, Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null) Parameters Type Name Description Toplevel view The Toplevel to run modally. Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler RELEASE builds only: Handler for any unhandled exceptions (resumes when returns true, rethrows when null). Remarks This method is used to start processing events for the main application, but it is also used to run other modal Views such as Dialog boxes. To make a Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) stop execution, call RequestStop(Toplevel). Calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) is equivalent to calling Begin(Toplevel), followed by RunLoop(RunState, bool), and then calling End(RunState). Alternatively, to have a program control the main loop and process events manually, call Begin(Toplevel) to set things up manually and then repeatedly call RunLoop(RunState, bool) with the wait parameter set to false. By doing this the RunLoop(RunState, bool) method will only process any pending events, timers, idle handlers and then return control immediately. RELEASE builds only: When errorHandler is null any exeptions will be rethrown. Otheriwse, if errorHandler will be called. If errorHandler returns true the RunLoop(RunState, bool) will resume; otherwise this method will exit. | Edit this page View Source RunLoop(RunState, bool) Building block API: Runs the MainLoop for the created Toplevel. Declaration public static void RunLoop(Application.RunState state, bool wait = true) Parameters Type Name Description Application.RunState state The state returned by the Begin(Toplevel) method. bool wait By default this is true which will execute the runloop waiting for events, if set to false, a single iteration will execute. Remarks Use the wait parameter to control whether this is a blocking or non-blocking call. | Edit this page View Source RunMainLoopIteration(ref RunState, bool, ref bool) Run one iteration of the MainLoop. Declaration public static void RunMainLoopIteration(ref Application.RunState state, bool wait, ref bool firstIteration) Parameters Type Name Description Application.RunState state The state returned by Begin(Toplevel). bool wait If true will execute the runloop waiting for events. If true will return after a single iteration. bool firstIteration Set to true if this is the first run loop iteration. Upon return, it will be set to false if at least one iteration happened. | Edit this page View Source Run<T>(Func<Exception, bool>, ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) Runs the application by calling Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) with a new instance of the specified Toplevel-derived class. Calling Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) first is not needed as this function will initialze the application. Shutdown() must be called when the application is closing (typically after Run> has returned) to ensure resources are cleaned up and terminal settings restored. Declaration public static void Run<T>(Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler = null, ConsoleDriver driver = null, IMainLoopDriver mainLoopDriver = null) where T : Toplevel, new() Parameters Type Name Description Func<Exception, bool> errorHandler ConsoleDriver driver The ConsoleDriver to use. If not specified the default driver for the platform will be used (WindowsDriver, CursesDriver, or NetDriver). This parameteter must be null if Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) has already been called. IMainLoopDriver mainLoopDriver Specifies the MainLoop to use. Type Parameters Name Description T Remarks See Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) for more details. | Edit this page View Source Shutdown() Shutdown an application initialized with Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver). Declaration public static void Shutdown() Remarks Shutdown must be called for every call to Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver) or Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>) to ensure all resources are cleaned up (Disposed) and terminal settings are restored. | Edit this page View Source UngrabMouse() Releases the mouse grab, so mouse events will be routed to the view on which the mouse is.

Items in the can be activated firing an event (with the ENTER key or a mouse double-click). If the AllowsMarking property is true, elements of the list can be marked by the user. By default ListView uses ToString() to render the items of any IList object (e.g. arrays, List<T>, and other collections). Alternatively, an object that implements IListDataSource can be provided giving full control of what is rendered. ListView can display any object that implements the IList interface. string values are converted into NStack.ustring values before rendering, and other values are converted into string by calling ToString() and then converting to NStack.ustring . To change the contents of the ListView, set the Source property (when providing custom rendering via IListDataSource) or call SetSource(IList) an IList is being used. When AllowsMarking is set to true the rendering will prefix the rendered items with [x] or [ ] and bind the SPACE key to toggle the selection. To implement a different marking style set AllowsMarking to false and implement custom rendering. Searching the ListView with the keyboard is supported. Users type the first characters of an item, and the first item that starts with what the user types will be selected.

They return control to the caller when RequestStop(Toplevel) has been called (which sets the Running property to false). A Toplevel is created when an application initializes Terminal.Gui by calling Init(ConsoleDriver, IMainLoopDriver). The application Toplevel can be accessed via Top. Additional Toplevels can be created and run (e.g. Dialogs. To run a Toplevel, create the Toplevel and call Run(Toplevel, Func<Exception, bool>). Toplevels can also opt-in to more sophisticated initialization by implementing ISupportInitialize. When they do so, the BeginInit() and EndInit() methods will be called before running the view. If first-run-only initialization is preferred, the ISupportInitializeNotification can be implemented too, in which case the ISupportInitialize methods will only be called if IsInitialized is false. This allows proper View inheritance hierarchies to override base class layout code optimally by doing so only on first run, instead of on every run.

Declaration public override bool ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Contains the details about the key that produced the event. Returns Type Description bool Overrides View.ProcessColdKey(KeyEvent) Remarks After keys are sent to the subviews on the current view, all the view are processed and the key is passed to the views to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a cold-key. This functionality is used, for example, by default buttons to act on the enter key. Processing this as a hot-key would prevent non-default buttons from consuming the enter keypress when they have the focus. | Edit this page View Source ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent) This method can be overwritten by view that want to provide accelerator functionality (Alt-key for example). Declaration public override bool ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Returns Type Description bool Overrides View.ProcessHotKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Before keys are sent to the subview on the current view, all the views are processed and the key is passed to the widgets to allow some of them to process the keystroke as a hot-key. For example, if you implement a button that has a hotkey ok \"o\", you would catch the combination Alt-o here. If the event is caught, you must return true to stop the keystroke from being dispatched to other views. | Edit this page View Source ProcessKey(KeyEvent) If the view is focused, gives the view a chance to process the keystroke. Declaration public override bool ProcessKey(KeyEvent keyEvent) Parameters Type Name Description KeyEvent keyEvent Contains the details about the key that produced the event. Returns Type Description bool Overrides View.ProcessKey(KeyEvent) Remarks Views can override this method if they are interested in processing the given keystroke. If they consume the keystroke, they must return true to stop the keystroke from being processed by other widgets or consumed by the widget engine. If they return false, the keystroke will be passed using the ProcessColdKey method to other views to process. The View implementation does nothing but return false, so it is not necessary to call base.ProcessKey if you derive directly from View, but you should if you derive other View subclasses. | Edit this page View Source Redraw(Rect) Redraws this view and its subviews; only redraws the views that have been flagged for a re-display. Declaration public override void Redraw(Rect bounds) Parameters Type Name Description Rect bounds The bounds (view-relative region) to redraw. Overrides View.Redraw(Rect) Remarks Always use Bounds (view-relative) when calling Redraw(Rect), NOT Frame (superview-relative). Views should set the color that they want to use on entry, as otherwise this will inherit the last color that was set globally on the driver. Overrides of Redraw(Rect) must ensure they do not set Driver.Clip to a clip region larger than the parameter, as this will cause the driver to clip the entire region. | Edit this page View Source Remove(View) Removes a subview added via Add(View) or Add(params View[]) from this View.

Views can contain one or more subviews, can respond to user input and render themselves on the screen. Views supports two layout styles: Absolute or Computed. The choice as to which layout style is used by the View is determined when the View is initialized. To create a View using Absolute layout, call a constructor that takes a Rect parameter to specify the absolute position and size (the View.Frame). To create a View using Computed layout use a constructor that does not take a Rect parameter and set the X, Y, Width and Height properties on the view. Both approaches use coordinates that are relative to the container they are being added to. To switch between Absolute and Computed layout, use the LayoutStyle property. Computed layout is more flexible and supports dynamic console apps where controls adjust layout as the terminal resizes or other Views change size or position. The X, Y, Width and Height properties are Dim and Pos objects that dynamically update the position of a view. The X and Y properties are of type Pos and you can use either absolute positions, percentages or anchor points. The Width and Height properties are of type Dim and can use absolute position, percentages and anchors. These are useful as they will take care of repositioning views when view's frames are resized or if the terminal size changes. Absolute layout requires specifying coordinates and sizes of Views explicitly, and the View will typically stay in a fixed position and size. To change the position and size use the Frame property. Subviews (child views) can be added to a View by calling the Add(View) method. The container of a View can be accessed with the SuperView property. To flag a region of the View's Bounds to be redrawn call SetNeedsDisplay(Rect). To flag the entire view for redraw call SetNeedsDisplay(). Views have a ColorScheme property that defines the default colors that subviews should use for rendering. This ensures that the views fit in the context where they are being used, and allows for themes to be plugged in. For example, the default colors for windows and toplevels uses a blue background, while it uses a white background for dialog boxes and a red background for errors. Subclasses should not rely on ColorScheme being set at construction time. If a ColorScheme is not set on a view, the view will inherit the value from its SuperView and the value might only be valid once a view has been added to a SuperView. By using ColorScheme applications will work both in color as well as black and white displays. Views that are focusable should implement the PositionCursor() to make sure that the cursor is placed in a location that makes sense. Unix terminals do not have a way of hiding the cursor, so it can be distracting to have the cursor left at the last focused view. So views should make sure that they place the cursor in a visually sensible place. The LayoutSubviews() method is invoked when the size or layout of a view has changed. The default processing system will keep the size and dimensions for views that use the Absolute, and will recompute the frames for the vies that use Computed.

    "title": "Namespace Terminal.Gui",
    "keywords": "Namespace Terminal.Gui Classes Application A static, singleton class providing the main application driver for Terminal.Gui apps. Application.ResizedEventArgs Event arguments for the Resized event. Application.RunState Captures the execution state for the provided Toplevel view. Autocomplete Renders an overlay on another view at a given point that allows selecting from a range of 'autocomplete' options. Border Draws a border, background, or both around another element. Border.ToplevelContainer A sealed Toplevel derived class to implement Border feature. This is only a wrapper to get borders on a toplevel and is recommended using another derived, like Window where is possible to have borders with or without border line or spacing around. Button Button is a View that provides an item that invokes an Action when activated by the user. CheckBox The CheckBox View shows an on/off toggle that the user can set Clipboard Provides cut, copy, and paste support for the OS clipboard. ClipboardBase Shared abstract class to enforce rules from the implementation of the IClipboard interface. CollectionNavigator Navigates a collection of items using keystrokes. The keystrokes are used to build a search string. The SearchString is used to find the next item in the collection that matches the search string when GetNextMatchingItem(int, char) is called. If the user types keystrokes that can't be found in the collection, the search string is cleared and the next item is found that starts with the last keystroke. If the user pauses keystrokes for a short time (see TypingDelay), the search string is cleared. CollectionNavigator.KeystrokeNavigatorEventArgs Event arguments for the SearchStringChanged event. ColorPicker The ColorPicker View Color picker. ColorScheme Defines the color Attributes for common visible elements in a View. Containers such as Window and FrameView use ColorScheme to determine the colors used by sub-views. Colors The default ColorSchemes for the application.

There are currently three implementations: CursesDriver (for Unix and Mac), WindowsDriver, and NetDriver that uses the .NET Console API. ConsoleKeyMapping Helper class to handle the scan code and virtual key from a ConsoleKey. ContextMenu ContextMenu provides a pop-up menu that can be positioned anywhere within a View. ContextMenu is analogous to MenuBar and, once activated, works like a sub-menu of a MenuBarItem (but can be positioned anywhere). By default, a ContextMenu with sub-menus is displayed in a cascading manner, where each sub-menu pops out of the ContextMenu frame (either to the right or left, depending on where the ContextMenu is relative to the edge of the screen). By setting UseSubMenusSingleFrame to true, this behavior can be changed such that all sub-menus are drawn within the ContextMenu frame. ContextMenus can be activated using the Shift-F10 key (by default; use the Key to change to another key). Callers can cause the ContextMenu to be activated on a right-mouse click (or other interaction) by calling Show(). ContextMenus are located using screen using screen coordinates and appear above all other Views.

MenuBar Provides a menu bar that spans the top of a Toplevel View with drop-down and cascading menus. By default, any sub-sub-menus (sub-menus of the MenuItems added to MenuBarItems) are displayed in a cascading manner, where each sub-sub-menu pops out of the sub-menu frame (either to the right or left, depending on where the sub-menu is relative to the edge of the screen). By setting UseSubMenusSingleFrame to true, this behavior can be changed such that all sub-sub-menus are drawn within a single frame below the MenuBar.

StackExtensions Extension of Stack<T> helper to work with specific IEqualityComparer<T> StatusBar A status bar is a View that snaps to the bottom of a Toplevel displaying set of StatusItems. The StatusBar should be context sensitive. This means, if the main menu and an open text editor are visible, the items probably shown will be ~F1~ Help ~F2~ Save ~F3~ Load. While a dialog to ask a file to load is executed, the remaining commands will probably be ~F1~ Help. So for each context must be a new instance of a statusbar. StatusItem StatusItem objects are contained by StatusBar Views. Each StatusItem has a title, a shortcut (hotkey), and an Action that will be invoked when the Shortcut is pressed. The Shortcut will be a global hotkey for the application in the current context of the screen. The colour of the Title will be changed after each ~. A Title set to `~F1~ Help` will render as *F1* using HotNormal and *Help* as HotNormal.
