# Recording Terminal.Gui Apps with `tuirec`

Use this guide when an issue or PR asks for a GIF/video capture of a Terminal.Gui
app or scenario. The recording tool is [`gui-cs/tuirec`](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec) —
a Go CLI that spawns the target app in a PTY, injects keystrokes, records terminal
output as an asciinema v2 cast, and renders an animated GIF via `agg`.

## Install

```powershell
# Requires Go 1.22+
go install github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/cmd/tuirec@latest
tuirec --version

# agg is auto-downloaded on first use — no separate install needed.
```

Verify: `tuirec --version`. If not on PATH, add `$(go env GOPATH)\bin` to PATH.

## Quick Start — Recording a UICatalog Scenario

```powershell
# 1. Build ScenarioRunner (do this ONCE before recording)
dotnet build Examples/ScenarioRunner/ScenarioRunner.csproj -c Release

# 2. Record (cross-platform: use dotnet to run the DLL)
$dll = "./Examples/ScenarioRunner/bin/Release/net10.0/ScenarioRunner.dll"
$ks = 'wait:1200,Tab,Tab,wait:400,A,wait:1800,B,o,wait:1800,E,wait:1800,Tab,wait:400,CursorDown,CursorDown,CursorDown,wait:400,Shift+F10,wait:1500,Escape,wait:400,Escape'

tuirec record `
    --binary dotnet `
    --args "$dll,run,Character Map" `
    --name CharacterMap `
    --title "Character Map" `
    --keystrokes $ks `
    --startup-delay 2000 `
    --drain 1500 `
    --cols 120 --rows 30 `
    --open --copy
```

Output: `artifacts/CharacterMap.gif` and `artifacts/CharacterMap.cast`.

Copy the GIF to the scenario directory:
```powershell
Copy-Item artifacts/CharacterMap.gif Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/CharacterMap/CharacterMap.gif
```

## Recording UICatalog Scenarios

### Prerequisites

1. **Build ScenarioRunner** — always build before recording to avoid startup noise:
   ```powershell
   dotnet build Examples/ScenarioRunner/ScenarioRunner.csproj -c Release
   ```
2. **Know the scenario name** — list available scenarios:
   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project Examples/ScenarioRunner -c Release --no-build -- list
   ```

### Finding the Right Keystrokes

Each scenario has a `GetDemoKeyStrokes()` method that defines a canonical
interaction sequence for benchmarking. **Use this as your starting point:**

```powershell
# Find the demo keystrokes for a scenario:
grep -n "GetDemoKeyStrokes" Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/<ScenarioFile>.cs
```

The demo keystrokes show what keys the scenario expects and what UI flow is
interesting. Translate them to tuirec syntax:

| Terminal.Gui Key | tuirec Token |
|---|---|
| `Key.CursorDown` | `CursorDown` |
| `Key.CursorLeft` | `CursorLeft` |
| `Key.Tab` | `Tab` |
| `Key.Tab.WithShift` | `Shift+Tab` |
| `Key.Enter` | `Enter` |
| `Key.Esc` | `Esc` |
| `Key.B` | `B` (or `` `B` `` for literal) |

### Composing the Keystroke Script

**Principles for a great recording:**

1. **Start with `wait:1000`** — let the UI render fully after startup-delay.
2. **Add `wait:` between logical steps** — `wait:500` to `wait:1500` between
   groups of actions so viewers can follow what's happening.
3. **Keep it short** — 10–20 seconds of real-time interaction. Fewer keystrokes
   with generous waits beats many rapid keystrokes.
4. **Show variety** — demonstrate 2–3 features of the scenario, not just
   scrolling. Navigate between controls, trigger category changes, etc.
5. **End with `Escape`** — the default Terminal.Gui quit key.
6. **Avoid wide glyphs** — Emoji and CJK characters cause misaligned rendering
   in terminal recordings (agg renders each cell as monospace but wide glyphs
   consume 2 cells). Prefer categories with single-width characters (Arrows,
   Box Drawing, Block Elements, Mathematical Operators, etc.).

### Template Command

```powershell
$dll = "./Examples/ScenarioRunner/bin/Release/net10.0/ScenarioRunner.dll"
$ks = '<your keystroke script here>'

tuirec record `
    --binary dotnet `
    --args "$dll,run,<Scenario Name>" `
    --name <ScenarioName> `
    --title "<Scenario Name>" `
    --keystrokes $ks `
    --startup-delay 2000 `
    --drain 2000 `
    --cols 120 --rows 30 `
    --verbosity high `
    --open --copy

# Copy GIF to scenario directory
Copy-Item artifacts/<ScenarioName>.gif Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/<ScenarioDir>/<ScenarioName>.gif
```

### Output File Placement

GIFs live **alongside the `.cs` file they document**:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Scenario in a subdirectory | `Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/<ScenarioDir>/<ScenarioName>.gif` |
| Scenario directly in `Scenarios/` | `Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/<ScenarioName>.gif` |
| View-derived class | `docfx/images/views/<ViewName>.gif` |

Use `--name <ScenarioName>` (PascalCase matching the class name) so the output
file is named correctly. The `--name` value determines the artifact filenames.

### Critical: `--kitty-keyboard` Decision

**Known bug ([gui-cs/tuirec#54](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/54)):**
tuirec currently encodes navigation keys (`CursorUp`, `CursorDown`, `CursorLeft`,
`CursorRight`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`, `End`) incorrectly under
`--kitty-keyboard` — it sends fabricated CSI u codepoints that the Kitty spec
doesn't define. Terminal.Gui ignores or misinterprets these sequences.

**Workaround until fixed:**
- **Omit `--kitty-keyboard`** for demos that use navigation keys.
- **Add `--kitty-keyboard`** only when you need modifier disambiguation for
  non-navigation keys (`Ctrl+M` vs Enter, `Ctrl+I` vs Tab, `Ctrl+Q`, etc.)
  and the demo doesn't rely on arrow/page/home/end keys.

Once the bug is fixed, `--kitty-keyboard` should be the default for all
Terminal.Gui recordings (it provides cleaner modifier handling).

### `--args` for ScenarioRunner

The `--args` flag uses **comma-separated** values (not space-separated):

```powershell
--args "run,Character Map"      # Correct: two args ["run", "Character Map"]
--args "run Character Map"      # WRONG: one arg "run Character Map"
```

### PowerShell Quoting

Always assign keystrokes to a **single-quoted** `$ks` variable to preserve
backtick literals:

```powershell
# Correct — single quotes prevent PowerShell backtick interpolation:
$ks = 'wait:1000,`search text`,Enter,wait:500,Escape'

# WRONG — PowerShell eats the backticks:
--keystrokes "wait:1000,`search text`,Enter"
```

### Example: Character Map Scenario

```powershell
$dll = "./Examples/ScenarioRunner/bin/Release/net10.0/ScenarioRunner.dll"

# Navigate to category list, browse Arrows → Box Drawing → Emoji, then context menu
$ks = 'wait:1200,Tab,Tab,wait:400,A,wait:1800,B,o,wait:1800,E,wait:1800,Tab,wait:400,CursorDown,CursorDown,CursorDown,wait:400,Shift+F10,wait:1500,Escape,wait:400,Escape'

tuirec record `
    --binary dotnet `
    --args "$dll,run,Character Map" `
    --name CharacterMap `
    --title "Character Map" `
    --keystrokes $ks `
    --startup-delay 2000 `
    --drain 1500 `
    --cols 120 --rows 30 `
    --open --copy
```

**Script breakdown:**

| Step | Tokens | What happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | `wait:1200` | Let the CharMap UI fully render |
| 2 | `Tab,Tab` | Move focus to category list |
| 3 | `A` | CollectionNavigator jumps to "Arrows" |
| 4 | `wait:1800` | Pause so viewer sees arrow characters |
| 5 | `B,o` | Type "Bo" — jumps to "Box Drawing" |
| 6 | `wait:1800` | Pause so viewer sees box-drawing characters |
| 7 | `E` | Type "E" — jumps to "Emoji" |
| 8 | `wait:1800` | Pause so viewer sees emoji characters |
| 9 | `Tab` | Return focus to charmap grid |
| 10 | `CursorDown` ×3 | Navigate to a glyph |
| 11 | `Shift+F10` | Open context menu (Copy Glyph / Copy Code Point) |
| 12 | `wait:1500,Escape` | Let viewer see the menu, then dismiss |
| 13 | `Escape` | Quit |

**Key techniques demonstrated:**
- **CollectionNavigator typing** — type category name prefixes to jump directly
  (much better than scrolling through dozens of categories with arrow keys)
- **Context menu** — `Shift+F10` (the `PopoverMenu.DefaultKey`) shows the
  right-click menu on the selected glyph
- **Generous waits** — 1800ms between feature demonstrations so viewers
  can absorb each state change

## Recording Individual View Sub-classes with EnableForDesign

(Coming soon — will use a dedicated design-mode runner that instantiates
a single View with `EnableForDesign()` and records its interactions.)

---

## Recording Standalone Example Apps

For apps in `Examples/` that are not UICatalog scenarios:

```powershell
$dll = "./Examples/<AppName>/bin/Release/net10.0/<AppName>.dll"
$ks = 'wait:1000,<keystrokes>,Escape'

tuirec record `
    --binary dotnet `
    --args "$dll" `
    --name <app-id> `
    --title "<App Name> Demo" `
    --keystrokes $ks `
    --startup-delay 2000 `
    --drain 2000 `
    --cols 120 --rows 30 `
    --open --copy
```

## Raster graphics: Kitty (default) and sixel

Terminal.Gui's `ImageView` (with `UseRasterGraphics = true`) picks the best
raster protocol the terminal advertises: **Kitty graphics** when available,
otherwise **sixel**, otherwise cell rendering. Which one a recording captures
depends on what identity `tuirec` presents to the app.

- **`tuirec` ≥ v0.9.0 defaults to Kitty graphics.** It advertises a deterministic
  Kitty identity (a `KITTY_WINDOW_ID` marker) to the recorded app, so apps that
  prefer Kitty emit Kitty image escapes (`ESC _ G … ST`). The pinned
  `agg` (`v1.11.0-sixel`, built on a Kitty-capable `avt`) renders them in the GIF.
  This is the path the UICatalog **Mandelbrot** and **Images** scenarios take by
  default. Terminal.Gui detects Kitty support purely from the environment, so the
  app reports `Kitty … active` in its capability matrix with no extra flags.
- **Sixel** is still used when the app does not support Kitty, or you force the
  sixel path in-app (e.g. the Mandelbrot scenario's "Sixel" protocol option).
- **Both are Linux/macOS only.** Windows ConPTY strips both Kitty graphics APC
  strings and sixel DCS from the output stream, so neither is captured there.

**Confirm which protocol the cast captured** (the `.cast` is JSON, so the escape
introducer shows up as ``):

```powershell
# Kitty graphics payloads (expected by default on Linux/macOS):
Select-String -Path artifacts/<name>.cast -Pattern 'u001b_G' | Measure-Object
# Sixel image DCS (expected only when the app uses the sixel path):
Select-String -Path artifacts/<name>.cast -Pattern 'u001bPq' | Measure-Object
```

The sixel cell-size verification below applies to the **sixel** path; the
[#84](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/84) cell-resolution mismatch is a
sixel concern and does not apply when the app renders via Kitty graphics.

> **Smooth zoom/pan recordings.** Each keystroke pauses `--keystroke-delay` ms
> (default 200). For continuous-looking motion (e.g. zooming/panning an image),
> use a shorter delay (`--keystroke-delay 130`) and many small steps rather than
> a few large ones. Note that in-app *mouse-wheel* zoom may not work under
> `tuirec` (some views bind the wheel to pan); prefer the keyboard zoom keys.

## Verifying Placement and Size (measure — don't eyeball)

**The recurring trap.** Confirming a sixel *appears* in the GIF — or that agg
rendered it faithfully at the cursor cell the app requested — does **not** prove
it is correct. A pixel-perfect render of a raster that was *built from the wrong
cell size* is still the wrong size on screen. "Looks present" and "pipeline is
faithful" are proxies. The invariant you must actually check is:

> **Does the rendered sixel cover the cells the app intended — in both position
> and size?**

Verify that with a measurement, not your eyes. A ~4% size error is invisible by
sight and obvious by arithmetic.

**Why this bites with tuirec specifically.** tuirec advertises a sixel cell
resolution (e.g. `8×17` px) that does **not** match agg's actual rendered font
cell (~`8.3×18.8` px at the default `--font-size 14`) — see
[#84](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/84). An app that *correctly* sizes
its raster as `cells × reportedResolution` (and fills exactly on a real sixel
terminal) therefore renders ~4% **undersized** under tuirec. Do not "fix" the app
for this; verify it and attribute it correctly.

**The check — calibrate agg's real cell, then reconcile:**

1. Extract a frame from the GIF (any decoder; e.g. ImageSharp
   `Image.Load(gif).Frames.CloneFrame(i)`).
2. Measure agg's **actual** cell size from a *known* grid reference — e.g. a
   border/box that spans a known number of columns:
   `cellPx = borderSpanPx / (spannedCells)`. (Don't trust `imageWidth / cols` —
   agg adds margins.)
3. Read the resolution the **app** used from the cast: the sixel DCS header
   `P…q"asp;asp;WIDTH;HEIGHT` gives raster pixel size; divide by the raster's
   cell count to get the app's px-per-cell.
4. **If agg's measured cell ≠ the app's px-per-cell, the sixel is mis-sized —
   and that is the tuirec mismatch ([#84](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/84)),
   not an app bug.** Then confirm the sixel's rendered bounding box actually spans
   the target region (the columns/rows it was meant to cover), not merely that it
   exists.

Run this whenever a sixel is sized or aligned to the text grid (bordered image
views, insets, bottom bands — anything grid-anchored). It turns "I think it looks
right" into a number, which is the only thing that catches sub-cell and
few-percent errors.

> **General principle (applies beyond sixel):** verify the *invariant the change
> was supposed to satisfy*, measured against the design intent — not that the tool
> ran, the file is non-empty, or the screenshot "has the thing in it." When you've
> just fixed one symptom, the next bug often hides in the dimension you didn't
> measure.

## Validation Checklist

After every recording, verify:

- [ ] `tuirec record` exited with code 0 and wrote both `.gif` and `.cast`.
- [ ] **Error check** — no errors in the cast:
  ```powershell
  Select-String -Path artifacts/<name>.cast -Pattern "error|unknown|not found|usage:" -CaseSensitive:$false
  ```
- [ ] **GIF is not blank** — file size > 100KB for a typical scenario recording.
      (A blank/static GIF is typically < 50KB.)
- [ ] **Visual check** — open the GIF (`--open` flag) and confirm:
  - The app content is visible (menu bar, controls, content).
  - The interaction sequence is visible (scrolling, focus changes, etc.).
  - The recording ends cleanly (no frozen frame or abrupt cutoff).
- [ ] **Output path is correct** — scenario GIFs go with their scenario code:
  ```
  Examples/UICatalog/Scenarios/<ScenarioDir>/<ScenarioName>.gif
  ```
- [ ] **Raster content recorded on Linux/macOS** — Kitty graphics APC and sixel
      DCS cannot be captured through Windows ConPTY. Confirm the expected protocol
      made it into the cast (Kitty is the default for raster apps; see *Raster
      graphics* above):
  ```powershell
  Select-String -Path artifacts/<name>.cast -Pattern 'u001b_G' | Measure-Object  # Kitty
  Select-String -Path artifacts/<name>.cast -Pattern 'u001bPq' | Measure-Object  # sixel
  ```
- [ ] **Grid-anchored sixel measured, not eyeballed** — if the sixel is sized or
      aligned to the text grid, calibrate agg's real cell and confirm the rendered
      bbox covers the target columns/rows (see *Verifying Placement and Size*
      above). A ~4% undersize from [#84](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/84)
      is invisible by sight.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No raster output on Windows | **Windows ConPTY strips Kitty graphics APC and sixel DCS** and does not pass the DA1 sixel handshake — the app detects no raster support | Record raster content (Kitty or sixel) on Linux/macOS (see `tuirec agent-guide`). On Windows you can still verify the app's raster code path runs (e.g., via an app-level force flag) by checking redraw activity in the `.cast`, but image pixels will not appear |
| Image renders via sixel instead of Kitty (or vice versa) | The app picks its preferred protocol from what the terminal advertises; `tuirec` ≥ v0.9.0 advertises Kitty by default | Confirm the captured protocol in the cast (`u001b_G` for Kitty, `u001bPq` for sixel). To force sixel, use the app's own protocol control (e.g. the Mandelbrot scenario's "Sixel" option) |
| Sixel renders ~4% too small / short of a border | tuirec advertises a cell resolution that doesn't match agg's rendered font cell ([#84](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/84)) | App is correct (fills on a real terminal). Verify by measurement (see *Verifying Placement and Size*); attribute to tuirec, not the app. Until fixed, only a tuirec-specific over-render hack would close the gap |
| Wide glyphs misaligned in GIF | Emoji/CJK chars are 2-cell wide; agg renders per-cell | Avoid emoji/CJK categories; use single-width ranges (Arrows, Box Drawing, etc.) |
| Nav keys ignored with `--kitty-keyboard` | tuirec bug [#54](https://github.com/gui-cs/tuirec/issues/54) — sends wrong codepoints | Remove `--kitty-keyboard` |
| App doesn't quit | Wrong quit key or key not delivered | Use `Escape` (the default quit key); check `--kitty-keyboard` interaction |
| Blank frames at start/end | Pre/postroll not trimmed | `--trim` is on by default in v0.4.2+; ensure tuirec is up-to-date |
| GIF validation: 1 frame | `--trim` removes all frames for static views | Use `--trim=false` for views with no visual change during demo |
| Recording times out | App stuck / wrong keystrokes | Check with `--verbosity high`, fix script |
| `--binary` permission error | Relative path on Windows | Use `./` prefix or absolute path with forward slashes |
| Backtick text missing | PowerShell interpolation | Use single-quoted `$ks` variable |

## Agent Workflow Summary

When asked to record a scenario GIF:

1. **Build** — `dotnet build Examples/ScenarioRunner -c Release`
2. **Find scenario name** — `dotnet run --project Examples/ScenarioRunner -c Release --no-build -- list`
3. **Read `GetDemoKeyStrokes()`** — find it in the scenario source file
4. **Compose keystrokes** — translate to tuirec syntax, add waits, keep short
5. **Record** — `tuirec record --binary ... --args "run,<Name>" --keystrokes $ks ...`
6. **Validate** — error-grep the cast, check GIF file size, confirm the interaction
   played. For anything sized/aligned to the grid (sixels especially),
   **measure** placement and size against the design intent — do not stop at
   "the screenshot has the thing in it" (see *Verifying Placement and Size*).
7. **If nav keys fail** — remove `--kitty-keyboard` and retry
8. **Report** — share the output paths and exact command used
