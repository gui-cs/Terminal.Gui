This directory contains a copy of the MonoCurses binding from:

http://github.com/mono/mono-curses

The source code has been exported in a way that the MonoCurses
API is kept private and does not surface to the user, this is
done with the command:

```
	make publish-to-gui
```

In the MonoCurses package
