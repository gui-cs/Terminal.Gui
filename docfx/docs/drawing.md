# Drawing (Text, Lines, and Color)

Terminal.Gui provides a set of APIs for formatting text, line drawing, and character-based graphing. 

## Drawing Taxonomy & Lexicon

[!INCLUDE [Drawing Lexicon](~/includes/drawing-lexicon.md)]

# View Drawing API

Terminal.Gui apps draw using the `Move()` and `AddRune()` APIs. Move selects the column and row of the cell and AddRune places the specified glyph in that cell using the <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Attribute> that was most recently set via `SetAttribute()`. The driver caches all changed Cells and efficiently outputs them to the terminal each iteration of the Application. In other words, Terminal.Gui uses deferred rendering. 

## Drawing Lifecycle

**Drawing occurs during Application MainLoop iterations**, not immediately when draw-related methods are called. This deferred rendering approach provides better performance and ensures visual consistency.

### MainLoop Iteration Process

Each iteration of the <xref:Terminal.Gui.App.Application> MainLoop (throttled to a maximum rate) performs these steps in order:

1. **Layout** - Views that need layout are measured and positioned (`LayoutSubviews()` is called)
2. **Draw** - Views that need drawing update the driver's back buffer (`Draw()` is called)
3. **Write** - The driver writes changed portions of the back buffer to the actual terminal
4. **Cursor** - The driver ensures the cursor is positioned correctly with appropriate visibility

### When Drawing Actually Occurs

- **Normal Operation**: Drawing happens automatically during MainLoop iterations when <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View.NeedsDraw> or `SubViewNeedsDraw` is set
- **Forced Update**: <xref:Terminal.Gui.App.Application.LayoutAndDraw(System.Boolean)> can be called to immediately trigger layout and drawing outside of the normal iteration cycle
- **Testing**: Tests can call `Draw()` directly to update the back buffer, then call `IDriver.Refresh()` to output to the terminal

**Important**: Calling `View.Draw()` does not immediately update the terminal screen. It only updates the driver's back buffer. The actual terminal output occurs when the driver's `Refresh()` method is called, which happens automatically during MainLoop iterations.

## Coordinate System for Drawing

The <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View> draw APIs all take coordinates specified in *Viewport-Relative* coordinates. That is, `0, 0` is the top-left cell visible to the user.

See [Layout](layout.md) for more details of the Terminal.Gui coordinate system.

## Outputting unformatted text

1) Moving the draw cursor using `Move()`.
2) Setting the attributes using `SetAttribute()`.
3) Outputting glyphs by calling `AddRune()` or `AddStr()` .

## Outputting formatted text

1) Adding the text to a <xref:Terminal.Gui.Text.TextFormatter> object.
2) Setting formatting options, such as `TextFormatter.Alignment`.
3) Calling `TextFormatter.Draw()`(Terminal.Gui.IDriver, System.Drawing.Rectangle,Terminal.Gui.Attribute,Terminal.Gui.Attribute,System.Drawing.Rectangle).

## Line Drawing

See [LineCanvas Deep Dive](#linecanvas-deep-dive) below.

## View.Draw — Per-View Drawing Flow

When `View.Draw()` is called on a view that has <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View.NeedsDraw> or `SubViewNeedsDraw` set, it executes these steps in order:

1. **Draw Adornments** — Draws the <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Border> and <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Padding> frames (fills and line art). Non-transparent <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Margin> is also drawn here. Transparent margins (those with shadows) are deferred to a second pass.
2. **Clip to Viewport** — Sets the clip region to the view's Viewport, preventing content from drawing outside it.
3. **Clear Viewport** — Fills the viewport with the background color.
4. **Draw SubViews** — Draws SubViews in reverse Z-order (earliest added = highest Z = drawn last, on top). For SubViews with `SuperViewRendersLineCanvas = true`, their <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas> is merged into the parent's canvas for unified intersection resolution. Overlapped SubViews' canvases are collected for painters'-algorithm compositing.
5. **Draw Text** — Renders `View.Text` via <xref:Terminal.Gui.Text.TextFormatter>.
6. **Draw Content** — Raises `DrawingContent` (override `OnDrawingContent` for custom drawing).
7. **Draw Adornment SubViews** — Draws SubViews of <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Border> and <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Padding> (e.g., tab headers, diagnostic indicators). Their <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas> lines are merged into the parent's canvas.
8. **Render LineCanvas** — Resolves all lines (including merged lines from adornments and SubViews) into glyphs via `GetCellMap`, then composites overlapped canvases using the painters' algorithm.
9. **Cache Clip for Margin** — If the <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Margin> has a shadow, the current clip is cached for the second-pass shadow render.
10. **DrawComplete & Clip Exclusion** — Raises `DrawComplete`. For opaque views, the entire frame is excluded from the clip. For transparent views, only the actually-drawn cells are excluded. This ensures later-drawn (lower-Z) views don't overwrite this view's content.

### Peer-View Draw Loop

The static `View.Draw(views, force)` method orchestrates drawing a set of peer views (views sharing the same SuperView):

1. Each peer view's `Draw()` is called in order.
2. After all peers complete, `MarginView.DrawMargins()` performs a **second pass** that draws transparent margins (shadows). This ensures shadows render on top of all other content. The cached clip from step 9 above is restored for each margin so the shadow draws into the correct region.
3. `NeedsDraw` flags are cleared on all peers.

### Declaring that Drawing is Needed

Call `SetNeedsDraw()` when something changes within a view's content area. Call `SetNeedsLayout()` when the viewport size needs recalculation. Both propagate up the view hierarchy via `SubViewNeedsDraw`.

**Note**: These methods do not cause immediate drawing. They mark the view for redraw in the next MainLoop iteration. To force immediate drawing (typically only in tests), call <xref:Terminal.Gui.App.Application.LayoutAndDraw(System.Boolean)>.

### Overriding Draw Behavior

Most draw steps can be overridden using the [Cancellable Work Pattern](cancellable-work-pattern.md). For example, to prevent the viewport from being cleared, override `OnClearingViewport()` to return `true`, or subscribe to the `ClearingViewport` event and set `Cancel = true`.

## Clipping

Clipping enables better performance and features like shadows by ensuring regions of the terminal that need to be drawn actually get drawn by the driver. Terminal.Gui supports non-rectangular clip regions with <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Region>. The driver.Clip is the application managed clip region and is managed by <xref:Terminal.Gui.App.Application>. Developers cannot change this directly, but can use `SetClipToScreen()`, `SetClip()`(Terminal.Gui.Region), `SetClipToFrame()`, etc...


## Cell

The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Cell> class represents a single cell on the screen. It contains a character and an attribute. The character is of type `Rune` and the attribute is of type <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Attribute>.

`Cell` is not exposed directly to the developer. Instead, the driver classes manage the `Cell` array that represents the screen.

To draw a `Cell` to the screen, use `Move()` to specify the row and column coordinates and then use the `AddRune()` method to draw a single glyph.  

## Attribute 

The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Attribute> class represents the formatting attributes of a `Cell`. It exposes properties for the foreground and background colors as well as the text style. The foreground and background colors are of type <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Color>. Bold, underline, and other formatting attributes are supported via the `Attribute.Style` property.

Use `SetAttribute()` to indicate which Attribute subsequent `AddRune()` and `AddStr()` calls will use:

```cs
// This is for illustration only. Developers typically use SetAttributeForRole instead.
SetAttribute (new Attribute (Color.Red, Color.Black, Style.Underline));
AddStr ("Red on Black Underlined.");
```

In the above example a hard-coded Attribute is set. Normally, developers will use `SetAttributeForRole()` to have the system use the Attributes associated with a `VisualRole` (see below).

```cs
// Modify the View's Scheme such that Focus is Red on Black Underlined
SetScheme (new Scheme (Scheme)
    {
        Focus = new Attribute (Color.Red, Color.Black, Style.Underline)
    });
    
SetAttributeForRole (VisualRole.Focus);
AddStr ("Red on Black Underlined.");
```

## Color

Terminal.Gui supports 24-bit true color (16.7 million colors) via the <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Color> struct. The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Color> struct represents colors in ARGB32 format, with separate bytes for Alpha (transparency), Red, Green, and Blue components.

### Standard Colors (W3C+)

Terminal.Gui provides comprehensive support for W3C standard color names plus additional common terminal colors via the <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.StandardColor> enum. This includes all standard W3C colors (like `AliceBlue`, `Red`, `Tomato`, etc.) as well as classic terminal colors (like `AmberPhosphor`, `GreenPhosphor`).

Colors can be created from standard color names:

```cs
var color1 = new Color(StandardColor.CornflowerBlue);
var color2 = new Color(StandardColor.Tomato);
var color3 = new Color("Red");  // Case-insensitive color name parsing
```

Standard colors can also be parsed from strings:

```cs
if (Color.TryParse("CornflowerBlue", out Color color))
{
    // Use the color
}
```

### Alpha Channel and Transparency

While <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Color> supports an alpha channel for transparency (values 0-255), **terminal rendering does not currently support alpha blending**. The alpha channel is primarily used to:

- Indicate whether a color should be rendered at all (alpha = 0 means fully transparent/don't render)
- Support future transparency features
- Enable terminal background pass-through (see [#2381](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/issues/2381) and [#4229](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/issues/4229))

**Important**: When matching colors to standard color names, the alpha channel is **ignored**. This means `Color(255, 0, 0, 255)` (opaque red) and `Color(255, 0, 0, 128)` (semi-transparent red) will both be recognized as "Red". This design decision supports the vision of enabling transparent backgrounds while still being able to identify colors semantically.

```cs
var opaqueRed = new Color(255, 0, 0, 255);
var transparentRed = new Color(255, 0, 0, 0);

// Both will resolve to "Red"
ColorStrings.GetColorName(opaqueRed);      // Returns "Red"
ColorStrings.GetColorName(transparentRed); // Returns "Red"
```

### Color.None (Terminal Default Colors)

`Color.None` is a special sentinel value (alpha=0) that tells the driver to emit ANSI reset codes (`CSI 39m` / `CSI 49m`) instead of explicit RGB values. This allows the terminal's native foreground/background colors — including any transparency or acrylic effects — to show through.

When `Color.None` is used in a <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Scheme>, the derivation algorithm resolves it to the terminal's actual default colors (detected via OSC 10/11 queries at startup) before performing color math. See [Scheme Deep Dive](scheme.md) for details.

### Dark/Light Background Awareness

The `Color.IsDarkColor()` method returns `true` if a color's HSL lightness is below 50%. This is used by the <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Scheme> derivation algorithm to determine the direction for `GetBrighterColor` and `GetDimmerColor`:

- `Color.GetBrighterColor(double, bool?)` — Makes a color more visually prominent. On dark backgrounds (or when auto-detecting), increases lightness. On light backgrounds, decreases lightness.
- `Color.GetDimmerColor(double, bool?)` — Makes a color less visually prominent. On dark backgrounds, decreases lightness. On light backgrounds, increases lightness (washes out toward white).

Both methods accept an optional `isDarkBackground` parameter. When `null` (the default), they auto-detect from the color's own lightness for backward compatibility. The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Scheme> derivation algorithm passes explicit values based on the resolved background color.

### Legacy 16-Color Support

For backwards compatibility and terminals with limited color support, Terminal.Gui maintains the legacy 16-color system via <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.ColorName16>. When true color is not available or when `Application.Force16Colors` is set, Terminal.Gui will map true colors to the nearest 16-color equivalent.

## VisualRole

Represents the semantic visual role of a visual element rendered by a View (e.g., Normal text, Focused item, Active selection).

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.VisualRole> provides a set of predefined VisualRoles:

[!code-csharp[VisualRole.cs](../../Terminal.Gui/Drawing/VisualRole.cs)]

## Schemes

[!INCLUDE [Scheme Overview](~/includes/scheme-overview.md)]

See [Scheme Deep Dive](scheme.md) for more details.

## Text Formatting

Terminal.Gui supports text formatting using <xref:Terminal.Gui.Text.TextFormatter>. <xref:Terminal.Gui.Text.TextFormatter> provides methods for formatting text using the following formatting options:

* Horizontal Alignment - Left, Center, Right
* Vertical Alignment - Top, Middle, Bottom
* Word Wrap - Enabled or Disabled
* Formatting Hot Keys

## Glyphs

The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Glyphs> class defines the common set of glyphs used to draw checkboxes, lines, borders, etc... The default glyphs can be changed per-ThemeScope via <xref:Terminal.Gui.Configuration.ConfigurationManager>. 

## LineCanvas Deep Dive

### What LineCanvas Does

Terminal UI borders are built from Unicode box-drawing characters: `─`, `│`, `┌`, `┐`, `┼`, `├`, and dozens more. When two borders meet, the correct junction glyph must be selected. Doing this by hand is tedious and error-prone.

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas> solves this. You describe *lines* — start point, length, orientation, style — and the canvas automatically resolves every intersection into the correct Unicode glyph. Where a horizontal and vertical line meet, it produces a `┼`. Where three lines meet, a `├`. Corners, T-junctions, and crosses are all handled automatically.

### Basic Usage

```csharp
LineCanvas lc = new ();

// Draw a 10-cell horizontal line
lc.AddLine (new Point (0, 0), 10, Orientation.Horizontal, LineStyle.Single);

// Draw a 5-cell vertical line crossing at (4, 0)
lc.AddLine (new Point (4, 0), 5, Orientation.Vertical, LineStyle.Single);

// Resolve all intersections and get the glyphs
Dictionary<Point, Cell?> cells = lc.GetCellMap ();
// At (4, 0), this returns a ┬ (top-tee), not a ─ or │
```

Each <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.StraightLine> is always horizontal or vertical. It has a `Start` point, a `Length` (positive = right/down, negative = left/up, zero = a single junction point), an `Orientation`, a <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineStyle>, and an optional color <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Attribute>.

### How Intersection Resolution Works

When you call `GetCellMap()`, the canvas walks every point within its bounds:

1. **Collect intersections.** For each point, every line that passes through it produces an <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.IntersectionDefinition> describing *how* the line relates to that point — does it pass over horizontally? Start here going right? End here from below?

2. **Determine glyph type.** The set of intersection types at a point is analyzed to decide the glyph category: corner, T-junction, cross, straight line, etc. For example, `{StartRight, StartDown}` = upper-left corner (`┌`).

3. **Select style variant.** The <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineStyle> of the intersecting lines determines which Unicode variant to render: single (`─`), double (`═`), heavy (`━`), dashed, dotted, or rounded.

4. **Filter exclusions.** Points in the exclusion region (see [Exclude](#linecanvasexclude--output-filter) below) are removed from the output.

### Line Styles

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineStyle> determines the glyph variant used for each line segment and intersection:

| Style | Horizontal | Vertical | Corner |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| `Single` | `─` | `│` | `┌` |
| `Double` | `═` | `║` | `╔` |
| `Heavy` | `━` | `┃` | `┏` |
| `Rounded` | `─` | `│` | `╭` |
| `Dashed` | `╌` | `╎` | `┌` |
| `Dotted` | `┄` | `┆` | `┌` |

When lines of different styles intersect, the canvas selects the appropriate mixed-style glyph (e.g., a single horizontal meeting a double vertical produces `╥`).

### Merging Canvases Across Views

Every <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View> has its own `LineCanvas`. During drawing, the framework merges canvases so that lines from different views auto-join seamlessly.

When `SuperViewRendersLineCanvas` is `true` on a SubView, its lines are merged into the SuperView's canvas via `LineCanvas.Merge()`. All lines then participate in a single intersection-resolution pass. This is how adjacent tab headers, nested frames, and other multi-view border compositions achieve connected line art.

SubViews that render their own `LineCanvas` independently (the default) are composited using a painters' algorithm during `View.RenderLineCanvas()`. Higher-Z views take priority; lower-Z cells only render if they provide richer junctions.

### `LineStyle.None` — A Convention, Not an Eraser

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineStyle.None> has **no special handling** inside <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas>. When passed to `AddLine`, the line is stored and participates in intersection resolution like any other. Because `None` doesn't match any styled-glyph check, it falls through to the default glyphs and **renders identically to `LineStyle.Single`**.

The "eraser" behavior in the LineDrawing scenario is implemented by the *consumer*, not by LineCanvas:

```csharp
// LineDrawing scenario — eraser logic on mouse-up
if (_currentLine.Style == LineStyle.None)
{
    // Physically remove overlapping segments from the line collection
    area.CurrentLayer = new LineCanvas (
        area.CurrentLayer.Lines.Exclude (
            _currentLine.Start,
            _currentLine.Length,
            _currentLine.Orientation));
}
```

This calls <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.StraightLineExtensions.Exclude*> to split and remove overlapping lines. The `None`-styled line itself is never kept.

> **Key point:** If you add a `LineStyle.None` line without eraser handling, it renders as a visible single-style line. To suppress lines, use the mechanisms described below.

### Suppressing and Removing Lines

LineCanvas provides three distinct mechanisms for controlling what gets drawn. Each operates at a different stage and has different semantics. Using the wrong one produces subtle bugs.

#### `LineCanvas.Exclude` — Output Filter

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas.Exclude*> suppresses resolved cells from `GetCellMap` output **without affecting the underlying geometry**. Lines still exist and still auto-join through excluded positions.

```csharp
LineCanvas lc = new ();
lc.AddLine (new (0, 0), 10, Orientation.Horizontal, LineStyle.Single);

// Exclude positions 3–5 (a title label occupies those cells)
lc.Exclude (new Region (new Rectangle (3, 0, 3, 1)));

// GetCellMap returns 7 cells (positions 0–2 and 6–9).
// The line auto-joins correctly on either side because
// the full line still participates in intersection resolution.
```

**Use this when something else is drawn at a position** — for example, a title label on a border. The border joins correctly on either side because the line is continuous behind the label.

**Do not use this as an eraser.** Because lines auto-join through excluded regions, phantom geometry leaks into junction decisions. A vertical line crossing an excluded horizontal line resolves as `┼` instead of `│`.

#### `Reserve` — Compositing Metadata

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.LineCanvas.Reserve*> marks positions as intentionally empty for multi-canvas compositing. It has **no effect** on the canvas that calls it — `GetCellMap` does not check reserved cells.

Reserved cells are consumed during `View.RenderLineCanvas`, which layers multiple independently-resolved canvases. Reserved cells claim positions so that cells from lower-Z canvases do not show through:

```csharp
// In a focused tab's border rendering:
// Reserve the gap where the header connects to the content area.
// This prevents the content area's top border from showing through.
lc.Reserve (new Rectangle (gapStart, borderY, gapWidth, 1));
```

#### `StraightLineExtensions.Exclude` — Geometry Surgery

<xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.StraightLineExtensions.Exclude*> physically splits or removes lines from a collection. This is the correct tool for erasing geometry:

```csharp
LineCanvas lc = new ();
lc.AddLine (new (0, 0), 10, Orientation.Horizontal, LineStyle.Single);

// Erase positions 4–5 by rebuilding the line collection
IEnumerable<StraightLine> remaining = lc.Lines.Exclude (
    new Point (4, 0), 2, Orientation.Horizontal);

LineCanvas erased = new (remaining);
// erased contains two separate segments: 0–3 and 6–9.
// A vertical line through x=4 correctly renders as │, not ┼.
```

> **Warning:** There are two unrelated methods named `Exclude`. `LineCanvas.Exclude (Region)` filters output while preserving auto-join. `StraightLineExtensions.Exclude (...)` physically removes geometry. They have opposite semantics.

#### Choosing the Right Mechanism

| Scenario | Mechanism | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Hide cells behind a title label | `LineCanvas.Exclude (Region)` | Lines auto-join through the label — the border looks continuous |
| Erase drawn lines | `StraightLineExtensions.Exclude (...)` | Geometry is physically removed — no phantom junctions |
| Gap where a focused tab meets content | `Reserve (Rectangle)` | Claims positions during compositing so lower-Z borders don't bleed through |
| "No border" on a view | Don't call `AddLine` | Check `if (style != LineStyle.None)` before adding |

## Thickness

Describes the thickness of a frame around a rectangle. The thickness is specified for each side of the rectangle using a <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Thickness> object. The Thickness class contains properties for the left, top, right, and bottom thickness. The <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.AdornmentImpl> class uses <xref:Terminal.Gui.Drawing.Thickness> to support drawing the frame around a view. 

See [View Deep Dive](View.md) for details.

## Diagnostics

The `ViewDiagnosticFlags.DrawIndicator` flag can be set on `View.Diagnostics` to cause an animated glyph to appear in the <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.Border> of each View. The glyph will animate each time that View's `Draw` method is called where either <xref:Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View.NeedsDraw> or `SubViewNeedsDraw` is set.

## Accessing Application Drawing Context

Views can access application-level drawing functionality through `View.App`:

```csharp
public class CustomView : View
{
    protected override bool OnDrawingContent()
    {
        // Access driver capabilities through View.App
        if (App?.Driver?.SupportsTrueColor == true)
        {
            // Use true color features
            SetAttribute(new Attribute(Color.FromRgb(255, 0, 0), Color.FromRgb(0, 0, 255)));
        }
        else
        {
            // Fallback to 16-color mode
            SetAttributeForRole(VisualRole.Normal);
        }
        
        AddStr("Custom drawing with application context");
        return true;
    }
}
