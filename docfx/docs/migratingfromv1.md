# Migrating From v1 To v2

This document provides an overview of the changes between Terminal.Gui v1 and v2. It is intended to help developers migrate their applications from v1 to v2.

For detailed breaking change documentation check out this Discussion: https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/discussions/2448

## View Constructors -> Initializers

In v1, [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml) and most sub-classes, had multiple constructors that took a variety of parameters. In v2, the constructors have been replaced with initializers. This change was made to simplify the API and make it easier to use. In addition, the v1 constructors drove a false (and needlessly complex) distinction between "Absoulte" and "Computed" layout. In v2, the layout system is much simpler and more intuitive.

### How to Fix

Replace the constructor calls with initializer calls.

```diff
- var myView = new View (new Rect (10, 10, 40, 10));
+ var myView = new View { X = 10, Y = 10, Width = 40, Height = 10 };
```

## TrueColor Support - 24-bit Color is the default

Terminal.Gui v2 now supports 24-bit color by default. This means that the colors you use in your application will be more accurate and vibrant. If you are using custom colors in your application, you may need to update them to use the new 24-bit color format.

The [Attribute](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Attribute.yml) class has been simplified. Color names now match the ANSI standard ('Brown' is now called 'Yellow')

### How to Fix

Static class `Attribute.Make` has been removed. Use constructor instead

```diff
- var c = Attribute.Make(Color.BrightMagenta, Color.Blue);
+ var c = new Attribute(Color.BrightMagenta, Color.Blue);
```

```diff
- var c = Color.Brown;
+ var c = Color.Yellow;
```

## Low-Level Type Changes

* `Rect` -> `Rectangle`
* `Point` -> `Point`
* `Size` -> `Size`

### How to Fix

* Replace `Rect` with `Rectangle`


## `NStack.string` has been removed. Use `System.Rune` instead. 

See [Unicode](https://gui-cs.github.io/Terminal.GuiV2Docs/docs/overview.html#unicode) for details.

### How to Fix

Replace `using` statements with the `System.Text` namespace

```diff
- using NStack;
+ using System.Text;
```

Anywhere you have an implicit cast from `char` to `Rune`, replace with a constructor call 

```diff
- myView.AddRune(col, row, '▄');
+ myView.AddRune(col, row, new Rune('▄'));
```

When measuring the screen space taken up by a `Rune` use `GetColumns()`

```diff
- Rune.ColumnWidth(rune);
+ rune.GetColumns();
```
When measuring the screen space taken up by a `string` you can use the extension method `GetColumns()`

```diff 
- myString.Sum(c=>Rune.ColumnWidth(c));
+ myString.GetColumns();
```

## `View Life Cycle Management

In v1, [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml) was derived from `Responder` which supported `IDisposable`. In v2, `Responder` has been removed and [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml) is the base-class supporting `IDisposable`. 

In v1, [Application.Init](~/api/Terminal.Gui./Terminal.Gui.Application.Init) automatically created a toplevel view and set [Applicaton.Top](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Applicaton.Top.yml). In v2, [Application.Init](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Application.Init.yml) no longer automatically creates a toplevel or sets [Applicaton.Top](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Applicaton.Top.yml); app developers must explicitly create the toplevel view and pass it to [Appliation.Run](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Appliation.Run.yml) (or use `Application.Run<myTopLevel>`). Developers are responsible for calling `Dispose` on any toplevel they create before exiting. 

### How to Fix

* Replace `Responder` with [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml)
* Update any code that assumes `Application.Init` automatically created a toplevel view and set `Applicaton.Top`.
* Update any code that assumes `Application.Init` automatically disposed of the toplevel view when the application exited.

## [Pos](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Pos.yml) and [Dim](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Dim.yml) types now adhere to standard C# idioms

* In v1, the [Pos](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Pos.yml) and [Dim](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Dim.yml) types (e.g. [Pos.PosView](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Pos.PosView.yml)) were nested classes and marked [internal](~/api/Terminal.Gui.internal.yml). In v2, they are no longer nested, and have appropriate public APIs. 
* Nullabilty is enabled.
* Methods & properties follow standards.
* The static method that creates a [PosAbsolute](~/api/Terminal.Gui.PosAbsolute.yml), `Pos.At`, was renamed to [Pos.Absolute](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Pos.Absolute.yml) for consistency.
* The static method that crates as [DimAbsoulte](~/api/Terminal.Gui.DimAbsoulte.yml), `Dim.Sized`, was renamed to [Dim.Absolute](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Dim.Absolute.yml) for consistency.

### How to Fix

* Search and replace `Pos.Pos` -> `Pos`.
* Search and replace `Dim.Dim` -> `Dim`.
* Search and replace `Pos.At` -> `Pos.Absolute`
* Search and replace `Dim.Sized` -> `Dim.Absolute`
* Search and replace `Dim.Anchor` -> `Dim.GetAnchor`
* Search and replace `Pos.Anchor` -> `Pos.GetAnchor`

## Layout Improvements

In v2, the layout system has been improved to make it easier to create complex user interfaces. If you are using custom layouts in your application, you may need to update them to use the new layout system.

* The distinction between `Absoulte Layout` and `Computed Layout` has been removed, as has the `LayoutStyle` enum. v1 drew a false distinction between these styles. 
* [View.Frame](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Frame.yml) now represents the position and size of the view in the superview's coordinate system. The `Frame` property is of type `Rectangle`.
* [View.Bounds](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Bounds.yml) has been replaced by [View.Viewport](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Viewport.yml). The `Viewport` property represents the visible area of the view in its own coordinate system. The `Viewport` property is of type `Rectangle`.
* [View.GetContentSize()](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.GetContentSize.yml) represents the size of the view's content. This replaces `ScrollView` and `ScrollBarView` in v1. See more below.

### How to Fix

### `Bounds` -> `Viewport`

* Remove all references ot `LayoutStyle`.
* Rename `Bounds` to `Viewport`. The `Location` property of `Bounds` can now have non-zero values.
* Update any code that assumed `Bounds.Location` was always `Point.Empty`.
* Update any code that used `Bounds` to refer to the size of the view's content. Use `GetContentSize()` instead.
* Update any code that assumed `Bounds.Size` was the same as `Frame.Size`. `Frame.Size` defines the size of the view in the superview's coordinate system, while `Viewport.Size` defines the visible area of the view in its own coordinate system.
* Use [View.GetAdornmentsThickness](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.GetAdornmentsThickness.yml) to get the total thickness of the view's border, margin, and padding.
* Not assume a View can draw outside of 'Viewport'. Use the 'Margin', 'Border', and 'Padding' Adornments to do things outside of `Viewport`. View subclasses should not implement their own concept of padding or margins but leverage these `Adornments` instead. 
* Mouse and draw events now provide coordinates relative to the `Viewport` not the `Frame`.

## `View.AutoSize` has been removed. Use [Dim.Auto](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Dim.Auto.yml) for width or height instead.

In v1, `View.AutoSize` was used to size a view to its `Text`. In v2, `View.AutoSize` has been removed. Use [Dim.Auto](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Dim.Auto.yml) for width or height instead.

### How to Fix

* Replace `View.AutoSize = true` with `View.Width = Dim.Auto` or `View.Height = Dim.Auto` as needed. See the [DimAuto Deep Dive](dimauto.md) for more information.

## Adornments

In v2, the `Border`, `Margin`, and `Padding` properties have been added to all views. This simplifies view development and enables a sophisticated look and feel. If you are using custom borders, margins, or padding in your application, you may need to update them to use the new properties.

* `View.Border` is now of type [Adornment](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Adornment.yml). [View.BorderStyle](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.BorderStyle.yml) is provided as a convenience property to set the border style (`myView.BorderStyle = LineStyle.Double`).

### How to Fix

## Built-in Scrolling

In v1, scrolling was enabled by using `ScrollView` or `ScrollBarView`. In v2, the base [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml) class supports scrolling inherently. The area of a view visible to the user at a given moment was previously a rectangle called `Bounds`. `Bounds.Location` was always `Point.Empty`. In v2 the visible area is a rectangle called `Viewport` which is a protal into the Views content, which can be bigger (or smaller) than the area visible to the user. Causing a view to scroll is as simple as changing `View.Viewport.Location`. The View's content described by [View.GetContentSize()](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.GetContentSize.yml). See [Layout](layout.md) for details.

### How to Fix

* Replace `ScrollView` with [View](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.yml) and use `Viewport` and [View.GetContentSize()](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.GetContentSize.yml) to control scrolling.
* Update any code that assumed `Bounds.Location` was always `Point.Empty`.
* Update any code that used `Bounds` to refer to the size of the view's content. Use [View.GetContentSize()](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.GetContentSize.yml) instead.
* Update any code that assumed `Bounds.Size` was the same as `Frame.Size`. `Frame.Size` defines the size of the view in the superview's coordinate system, while `Viewport.Size` defines the visible area of the view in its own coordinate system.

## Updated Keyboard API

The API for handling keyboard input is significantly improved. See [Keyboard API](keyboard.md).

* The [Key](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Key.yml) class replaces the `KeyEvent` struct and provides a platform-independent abstraction for common keyboard operations. It is used for processing keyboard input and raising keyboard events. This class provides a high-level abstraction with helper methods and properties for common keyboard operations. Use this class instead of the low-level [KeyCode](~/api/Terminal.Gui.KeyCode.yml) enum when possible. See [Key](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Key.yml) for more details.
* The preferred way to enable Application-wide or View-heirarchy-dependent keystrokes is to use the [Shortcut](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Shortcut.yml) View or the built-in View's that utilize it, such as the [Bar](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Bar.yml)-based views.
* The preferred way to handle single keystrokes is to use **Key Bindings**. Key Bindings map a key press to a [Command](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Command.yml). A view can declare which commands it supports, and provide a lambda that implements the functionality of the command, using `View.AddCommand()`. Use the [View.Keybindings](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Keybindings.yml) to configure the key bindings.
* For better consistency and user experience, the default key for closing an app or `Toplevel` is now `Esc` (it was previously `Ctrl+Q`).

### How to Fix

* Replace `KeyEvent` with `Key`
* Use [View.AddCommand](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.AddCommand.yml) to define commands your view supports.
* Use [View.Keybindings](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Keybindings.yml) to configure key bindings to `Command`s.
* It should be very uncommon for v2 code to override `OnKeyPressed` etc... 
* Anywhere `Ctrl+Q` was hard-coded as the "quit key", replace with `Application.QuitKey`.

## Updated Mouse API

The API for mouse input is now internally consistent and easier to use.

* The [MouseEvent](~/api/Terminal.Gui.MouseEvent.yml) class replaces `MouseEventEventArgs`.
* More granular APIs are provided to ease handling specific mouse actions. See [Mouse API](mouse.md).
* Views can use the [View.Highlight](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Highlight.yml) event to have the view be visibly highlighted on various mouse events.
* Views can set `View.WantContinousButtonPresses = true` to have their [Command.Accept](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Command.Accept.yml) command be invoked repeatedly as the user holds a mouse button down on the view.
* Mouse and draw events now provide coordinates relative to the `Viewport` not the `Screen`.

### How to Fix

* Replace `MouseEventEventArgs` with `MouseEvent`
* Use the [View.Highlight](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.Highlight.yml) event to have the view be visibly highlighted on various mouse events.
* Set `View.WantContinousButtonPresses = true` to have the [Command.Accept](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Command.Accept.yml) command be invoked repeatedly as the user holds a mouse button down on the view.
* Update any code that assumed mouse events provided coordinates relative to the `Screen`.

## Cursor and Focus

The cursor and focus system has been redesigned in v2 to be more consistent and easier to use. If you are using custom cursor or focus logic in your application, you may need to update it to use the new system.

### How to Fix

* Use [Application.MostFocusedView](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Application.MostFocusedView.yml) to get the most focused view in the application.
* Use [View.CursorPosition](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.CursorPosition.yml) to set the cursor position in a view. Set [View.CursorPosition](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.CursorPosition.yml) to `null` to hide the cursor.
* Set [View.CursorVisibility](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.CursorVisibility.yml) to the cursor style you want to use.
* Remove any overrides of `OnEnter` and `OnLeave` that explicitly change the cursor.

## Events now use `object sender, EventArgs args` signature

Previously events in Terminal.Gui used a mixture of `Action` (no arguments), `Action<string>` (or other raw datatype) and `Action<EventArgs>`. Now all events use the `EventHandler<EventArgs>` [standard .net design pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/event-pattern#event-delegate-signatures).

For example, `event Action`<long> TimeoutAdded` has become `event EventHandler<TimeoutEventArgs> TimeoutAdded`

This change was made for the following reasons:

- Event parameters are now individually named and documented (with xmldoc)
- Future additions to event parameters can be made without being breaking changes (i.e. adding new properties to the EventArgs class)

For example:

```csharp

public class TimeoutEventArgs : EventArgs {

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the <see cref="DateTime.Ticks"/> in UTC time when the 
	/// <see cref="Timeout"/> will next execute after.
	/// </summary>
	public long Ticks { get; }

[...]
}
```

## How To Fix
If you previously had a lamda expression, you can simply add the extra arguments:

```diff
- btnLogin.Clicked += () => { /*do something*/ };
+ btnLogin.Clicked += (s,e) => { /*do something*/ };
```

If you have used a named method instead of a lamda you will need to update the signature e.g.

```diff
- private void MyButton_Clicked ()
+ private void MyButton_Clicked (object sender, EventArgs e)
```

## `ReDraw` is now `Draw`

### How to Fix

* Replace `ReDraw` with `Draw`
* Mouse and draw events now provide coordinates relative to the `Viewport` not the `Frame`.

## No more nested classes

All public classes that were previously [nested classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/nested-types) are now in the root namespace as their own classes.

### How To Fix
Replace references to to nested types with the new standalone version

```diff
- var myTab = new TabView.Tab();
+ var myTab = new Tab();
```

## View and Text Alignment Changes

In v1, both `TextAlignment` and `VerticalTextAlignment` enums were used to align text in views. In v2, these enums have been replaced with the [Alignment](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Alignment.yml) enum. The [View.TextAlignment](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.TextAlignment.yml) property controls horizontal text alignment and the [View.VerticalTextAlignment](~/api/Terminal.Gui.View.VerticalTextAlignment.yml) property controls vertical text alignment.

v2 now supports [Pos.Align](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Pos.Align.yml) which enables views to be easily aligned within their Superview. 

The [Aligner](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Aligner.yml) class makes it easy to align elements (text, Views, etc...) within a container. 

### How to Fix

* Replace `VerticalAlignment.Middle` is now [Alignment.Center](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Alignment.Center.yml). 

## `StatusBar`- `StatusItem` is replaced by `Shortcut`

[StatusBar](~/api/Terminal.Gui.StatusBar.yml) has been upgraded to utilize [Shortcut](~/api/Terminal.Gui.Shortcut.yml).

### How to Fix

```diff
-  var statusBar = new StatusBar (
-                                       new StatusItem []
-                                       {
-                                           new (
-                                                Application.QuitKey,
-                                                $"{Application.QuitKey} to Quit",
-                                                () => Quit ()
-                                               )
-                                       }
-                                      );
+ var statusBar = new StatusBar (new Shortcut [] { new (Application.QuitKey, "Quit", Quit) });
```
