# InvokeLeakTest Failure Analysis

## Issue Summary
The `InvokeLeakTest` stress test fails **only on @BDisp's machine** and **only when running under a debugger**:
- Visual Studio 2022 on Windows (x64)
- Visual Studio 2022 on macOS (Intel-based VM)
- Visual Studio Code on Windows

The test passes in CI/CD environments and when run without a debugger.

## Test Description
`InvokeLeakTest` is a **stress test** (not a unit test) located in `Tests/StressTests/ApplicationStressTests.cs`. It:

1. Spawns multiple concurrent tasks that call `Application.Invoke()` from background threads
2. Each invocation updates a TextField and increments a counter using `Interlocked.Increment`
3. The test verifies that all invocations complete successfully (no "leaks")
4. Runs for 50 passes with 500 increments each (25,000 total invocations)

### Test Flow
```csharp
// Main thread blocks in Application.Run()
Application.Run(top);

// Background thread spawns tasks
for (var j = 0; j < NUM_PASSES; j++) {
    for (var i = 0; i < NUM_INCREMENTS; i++) {
        Task.Run(() => {
            Thread.Sleep(r.Next(2, 4));  // Random 2-4ms delay
            Application.Invoke(() => {
                tf.Text = $"index{r.Next()}";
                Interlocked.Increment(ref _tbCounter);
            });
        });
    }
    // Wait for counter to reach expected value with 100ms polling
    while (_tbCounter != expectedValue) {
        _wakeUp.Wait(POLL_MS);  // POLL_MS = 100ms
        if (_tbCounter hasn't changed) {
            throw new TimeoutException("Invoke lost");
        }
    }
}
```

## How Application.Invoke Works

### Call Chain
1. `Application.Invoke(action)` → calls `ApplicationImpl.Instance.Invoke(action)`
2. `ApplicationImpl.Invoke()` checks if on main thread:
   - **If on main thread**: Execute action immediately
   - **If on background thread**: Add to `_timedEvents` with `TimeSpan.Zero`
3. `TimedEvents.Add()`:
   - Calculates timestamp: `k = (DateTime.UtcNow + time).Ticks`
   - For `TimeSpan.Zero`, subtracts 100 ticks to ensure immediate execution: `k -= 100`
   - Adds to sorted list: `_timeouts.Add(NudgeToUniqueKey(k), timeout)`
4. `MainLoop.RunIteration()` calls `TimedEvents.RunTimers()` every iteration
5. `TimedEvents.RunTimers()`:
   - Takes a copy of `_timeouts` and creates a new list (under lock)
   - Iterates through copy, executing callbacks where `k < now`
   - Non-repeating callbacks (return false) are not re-added

### Critical Code Paths

#### ApplicationImpl.Invoke (Terminal.Gui/App/ApplicationImpl.cs:306-322)
```csharp
public void Invoke (Action action)
{
    // If we are already on the main UI thread
    if (Application.MainThreadId == Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
    {
        action ();
        return;
    }

    _timedEvents.Add (TimeSpan.Zero,
                      () =>
                      {
                          action ();
                          return false;  // One-shot execution
                      }
                     );
}
```

#### TimedEvents.AddTimeout (Terminal.Gui/App/Timeout/TimedEvents.cs:124-139)
```csharp
private void AddTimeout (TimeSpan time, Timeout timeout)
{
    lock (_timeoutsLockToken)
    {
        long k = (DateTime.UtcNow + time).Ticks;

        // if user wants to run as soon as possible set timer such that it expires right away
        if (time == TimeSpan.Zero)
        {
            k -= 100;  // Subtract 100 ticks to ensure it's "in the past"
        }

        _timeouts.Add (NudgeToUniqueKey (k), timeout);
        Added?.Invoke (this, new (timeout, k));
    }
}
```

#### TimedEvents.RunTimersImpl (Terminal.Gui/App/Timeout/TimedEvents.cs:160-192)
```csharp
private void RunTimersImpl ()
{
    long now = DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks;
    SortedList<long, Timeout> copy;

    lock (_timeoutsLockToken)
    {
        copy = _timeouts;
        _timeouts = new ();
    }

    foreach ((long k, Timeout timeout) in copy)
    {
        if (k < now)  // Execute if scheduled time is in the past
        {
            if (timeout.Callback ())  // Returns false for Invoke actions
            {
                AddTimeout (timeout.Span, timeout);
            }
        }
        else  // Future timeouts - add back to list
        {
            lock (_timeoutsLockToken)
            {
                _timeouts.Add (NudgeToUniqueKey (k), timeout);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Hypothesis: Why It Fails Under Debugger on @BDisp's Machine

### Primary Hypothesis: DateTime.UtcNow Resolution and Debugger Timing

The test failure likely occurs due to a combination of factors:

#### 1. **DateTime.UtcNow Resolution Issues**
The code uses `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` for timing, which has platform-dependent resolution:
- Windows: ~15.6ms resolution (system timer tick)
- Some systems: Can be lower/higher depending on timer configuration
- Debugger impact: Can affect system timer behavior

When `TimeSpan.Zero` invocations are added:
```csharp
long k = (DateTime.UtcNow + TimeSpan.Zero).Ticks;
k -= 100;  // Subtract 100 ticks (10 microseconds)
```

**The problem**: If two `Invoke` calls happen within the same timer tick (< ~15ms on Windows), they get the SAME `DateTime.UtcNow` value. The `NudgeToUniqueKey` function increments by 1 tick each collision, but this creates a sequence of timestamps like:
- First call: `now - 100`
- Second call (same UtcNow): `now - 99`
- Third call (same UtcNow): `now - 98`
- ...and so on

#### 2. **Race Condition in RunTimersImpl**
In `RunTimersImpl`, this check determines if a timeout should execute:
```csharp
if (k < now)  // k is scheduled time, now is current time
```

**The race**: Between when timeouts are added (with `k = UtcNow - 100`) and when they're checked (with fresh `DateTime.UtcNow`), time passes. However, if:
1. Multiple invocations are added rapidly (within same timer tick)
2. The system is under debugger (slower iteration loop)
3. The main loop iteration happens to sample `DateTime.UtcNow` at an unlucky moment

Some timeouts might have `k >= now` even though they were intended to be "immediate" (TimeSpan.Zero).

#### 3. **Debugger-Specific Timing Effects**

When running under a debugger:

**a) Slower Main Loop Iterations**
- Debugger overhead slows each iteration
- More time between `RunTimers` calls
- Allows more tasks to queue up between iterations

**b) Timer Resolution Changes**
- Debuggers can affect OS timer behavior
- May change quantum/scheduling of threads
- Different thread priorities under debugger

**c) DateTime.UtcNow Sampling**
- More invocations can accumulate in a single UtcNow "tick"
- Larger batches of timeouts with near-identical timestamps
- Higher chance of `k >= now` race condition

#### 4. **The "Lost Invoke" Scenario**

Failure scenario:
```
Time T0: Background thread calls Invoke()
         - k = UtcNow - 100 (let's say 1000 ticks - 100 = 900)
         - Added to _timeouts with k=900

Time T1: MainLoop iteration samples UtcNow = 850 ticks (!)
         - This can happen if system timer hasn't updated yet
         - Check: is k < now? Is 900 < 850? NO!
         - Timeout is NOT executed, added back to _timeouts

Time T2: Next iteration, UtcNow = 1100 ticks
         - Check: is k < now? Is 900 < 1100? YES!
         - Timeout executes

But if the test's 100ms polling window expires before T2, it throws TimeoutException.
```

#### 5. **Why @BDisp's Machine Specifically?**

Possible factors:
- **CPU/Chipset**: Intel vs ARM have different timer implementations
- **VM/Virtualization**: MacOS VM on Intel laptop may have timer virtualization quirks
- **OS Configuration**: Windows timer resolution settings (can be 1ms to 15.6ms)
- **Debugger Version**: Specific VS2022 build with different debugging hooks
- **System Load**: Background processes affecting timer accuracy
- **Hardware**: Specific timer hardware behavior on his x64 machine

### Secondary Hypothesis: Thread Scheduling Under Debugger

The test spawns tasks with `Task.Run()` and small random delays (2-4ms). Under a debugger:
- Thread scheduling may be different
- Task scheduling might be more synchronous
- More tasks could complete within same timer resolution window
- Creates "burst" of invocations that all get same timestamp

### Why It Doesn't Fail in CI/CD

CI/CD environments:
- Run without debugger (no debugging overhead)
- Different timer characteristics
- Faster iterations (less time for race conditions)
- Different CPU architectures (ARM runners have different timer behavior)

## Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis

1. **Test uses 100ms polling**: `_wakeUp.Wait(POLL_MS)` where `POLL_MS = 100`
   - This gives a narrow window for all invocations to complete
   - Any delay beyond 100ms triggers failure

2. **Test spawns 500 concurrent tasks per pass**: Each with 2-4ms delay
   - Under debugger, these could all queue up in < 100ms
   - But execution might take > 100ms due to debugger overhead

3. **Only fails under debugger**: Strong indicator of timing-related issue
   - Debugger affects iteration speed and timer behavior

4. **Platform-specific**: Fails on specific hardware/VM configurations
   - Suggests timer resolution/behavior differences

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Stopwatch Instead of DateTime.UtcNow (Recommended)
Replace `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` with `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp()` in `TimedEvents`:
- Higher resolution (typically microseconds)
- More consistent across platforms
- Less affected by system time adjustments
- Better for interval timing

### Solution 2: Increase TimeSpan.Zero Buffer
Change the immediate execution buffer from `-100` ticks to something more substantial:
```csharp
if (time == TimeSpan.Zero)
{
    k -= TimeSpan.TicksPerMillisecond * 10;  // 10ms in the past instead of 0.01ms
}
```

### Solution 3: Add Wakeup Call on Invoke
When adding a TimeSpan.Zero timeout, explicitly wake up the main loop:
```csharp
_timedEvents.Add(TimeSpan.Zero, ...);
MainLoop?.Wakeup();  // Force immediate processing
```

### Solution 4: Test-Specific Changes
For the test itself:
- Increase `POLL_MS` from 100 to 200 or 500 for debugger scenarios
- Add conditional: `if (Debugger.IsAttached) POLL_MS = 500;`
- This accommodates debugger overhead without changing production code

### Solution 5: Use Interlocked Operations More Defensively
Add explicit memory barriers and volatile reads to ensure visibility:
```csharp
volatile int _tbCounter;
// or
Interlocked.MemoryBarrier();
int currentCount = Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref _tbCounter, 0, 0);
```

## Additional Investigation Needed

To confirm hypothesis, @BDisp could:

1. **Add diagnostics to test**:
```csharp
var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
while (_tbCounter != expectedValue) {
    _wakeUp.Wait(pollMs);
    if (_tbCounter != tbNow) continue;
    
    // Log timing information
    Console.WriteLine($"Timeout at {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms");
    Console.WriteLine($"Counter: {_tbCounter}, Expected: {expectedValue}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Missing: {expectedValue - _tbCounter}");
    
    // Check if invokes are still queued
    Console.WriteLine($"TimedEvents count: {Application.TimedEvents?.Timeouts.Count}");
}
```

2. **Test timer resolution**:
```csharp
var samples = new List<long>();
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    samples.Add(DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks);
}
var deltas = samples.Zip(samples.Skip(1), (a, b) => b - a).Where(d => d > 0);
Console.WriteLine($"Min delta: {deltas.Min()} ticks ({deltas.Min() / 10000.0}ms)");
```

3. **Monitor TimedEvents queue**:
- Add logging in `TimedEvents.RunTimersImpl` to see when timeouts are deferred
- Check if `k >= now` condition is being hit

## Conclusion

The `InvokeLeakTest` failure under debugger is likely caused by:
1. **Low resolution of DateTime.UtcNow** combined with rapid invocations
2. **Race condition** in timeout execution check (`k < now`)
3. **Debugger overhead** exacerbating timing issues
4. **Platform-specific timer behavior** on @BDisp's hardware/VM

The most robust fix is to use `Stopwatch` for timing instead of `DateTime.UtcNow`, providing:
- Higher resolution timing
- Better consistency across platforms
- Reduced susceptibility to debugger effects

This is a **timing/performance issue** in the stress test environment, not a functional bug in the production code. The test is correctly identifying edge cases in high-concurrency scenarios that are more likely to manifest under debugger overhead.
