///         <see cref="LineCanvas"/> is the core rendering primitive for borders, frames, and any box-drawing art
///         in Terminal.Gui. Lines are added via <see cref="AddLine(Point, int, Orientation, LineStyle, Attribute?)"/>
///         and the canvas automatically resolves intersections — where two lines cross or meet, the correct Unicode
///         junction glyph (T, cross, corner, etc.) is produced. This makes it trivial to compose complex bordered
///         layouts without manually computing junction characters.
///     </para>

///         <b>Merging and SuperViewRendersLineCanvas.</b> When <see cref="View.SuperViewRendersLineCanvas"/> is
///         <see langword="true"/> on a SubView, the SubView's <see cref="LineCanvas"/> is merged into the
///         SuperView's canvas via <see cref="Merge(LineCanvas)"/>. All lines then participate in a single
///         intersection-resolution pass, producing seamless junctions across view boundaries. This is how
///         adjacent tab headers, nested frames, and other multi-view border compositions achieve connected
///         line art.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Exclusion regions</b> (<see cref="Exclude"/>). Prevents resolved cells from appearing in
///         <see cref="GetCellMap"/> output. Lines still exist in the canvas and still participate in
///         intersection resolution (auto-join), but excluded positions are filtered out of the final
///         output. Use this when something else has already been drawn at a position — for example,
///         a title label on a border, or a SubView that renders its own <see cref="LineCanvas"/>
///         independently.

///     <para>
///         <b>Reserved cells</b> (<see cref="Reserve"/>). Marks positions as intentionally empty —
///         no line exists here and none should be rendered by other canvases either. Unlike
///         <see cref="Exclude"/>, reserved cells have no effect on this canvas's resolution or
///         output. They are metadata consumed during multi-canvas compositing
///         (see <see cref="View.RenderLineCanvas"/>): when multiple independently-resolved canvases
///         are layered, reserved cells claim their positions so that cells from canvases composited
///         later do not show through. Use this for intentional gaps in borders, such as the opening
///         where a focused tab header connects to the content area.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Clipped merge.</b> The <c>Merge(LineCanvas, Region?)</c> overload supports merging with
///         an exclusion region that clips incoming lines at the line level — before intersection resolution.
///         Excluded cells are not added as lines and therefore do not participate in auto-join. Note that this
///         can fragment lines and produce incorrect junction glyphs; prefer per-canvas resolution with
///         <see cref="Reserve"/> and compositing for overlapped views.
