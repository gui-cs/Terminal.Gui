	/// View is the base class for all views on the screen and represents a visible element that can render itself and 
	/// contains zero or more nested views, called SubViews.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	///    The View defines the base functionality for user interface elements in Terminal.Gui. Views
	///    can contain one or more subviews, can respond to user input and render themselves on the screen.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Views supports two layout styles: <see cref="LayoutStyle.Absolute"/> or <see cref="LayoutStyle.Computed"/>. 
	///    The choice as to which layout style is used by the View 
	///    is determined when the View is initialized. To create a View using Absolute layout, call a constructor that takes a
	///    Rect parameter to specify the absolute position and size (the View.<see cref="View.Frame "/>). To create a View 
	///    using Computed layout use a constructor that does not take a Rect parameter and set the X, Y, Width and Height 
	///    properties on the view. Both approaches use coordinates that are relative to the container they are being added to. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    To switch between Absolute and Computed layout, use the <see cref="LayoutStyle"/> property. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Computed layout is more flexible and supports dynamic console apps where controls adjust layout
	///    as the terminal resizes or other Views change size or position. The X, Y, Width and Height 
	///    properties are Dim and Pos objects that dynamically update the position of a view.
	///    The X and Y properties are of type <see cref="Pos"/>
	///    and you can use either absolute positions, percentages or anchor
	///    points. The Width and Height properties are of type
	///    <see cref="Dim"/> and can use absolute position,
	///    percentages and anchors. These are useful as they will take
	///    care of repositioning views when view's frames are resized or
	///    if the terminal size changes.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Absolute layout requires specifying coordinates and sizes of Views explicitly, and the
	///    View will typically stay in a fixed position and size. To change the position and size use the
	///    <see cref="Frame"/> property.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Subviews (child views) can be added to a View by calling the <see cref="Add(View)"/> method. 
	///    The container of a View can be accessed with the <see cref="SuperView"/> property.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    To flag a region of the View's <see cref="Bounds"/> to be redrawn call <see cref="SetNeedsDisplay(Rect)"/>. 
	///    To flag the entire view for redraw call <see cref="SetNeedsDisplay()"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Views have a <see cref="ColorScheme"/> property that defines the default colors that subviews
	///    should use for rendering. This ensures that the views fit in the context where
	///    they are being used, and allows for themes to be plugged in. For example, the
	///    default colors for windows and toplevels uses a blue background, while it uses
	///    a white background for dialog boxes and a red background for errors.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Subclasses should not rely on <see cref="ColorScheme"/> being
	///    set at construction time. If a <see cref="ColorScheme"/> is not set on a view, the view will inherit the
	///    value from its <see cref="SuperView"/> and the value might only be valid once a view has been
	///    added to a SuperView. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    By using  <see cref="ColorScheme"/> applications will work both
	///    in color as well as black and white displays.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    Views that are focusable should implement the <see cref="PositionCursor"/> to make sure that
	///    the cursor is placed in a location that makes sense. Unix terminals do not have
	///    a way of hiding the cursor, so it can be distracting to have the cursor left at
	///    the last focused view. So views should make sure that they place the cursor
	///    in a visually sensible place.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///    The <see cref="LayoutSubviews"/> method is invoked when the size or layout of a view has
	///    changed. The default processing system will keep the size and dimensions
	///    for views that use the <see cref="LayoutStyle.Absolute"/>, and will recompute the
	///    frames for the vies that use <see cref="LayoutStyle.Computed"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///     Views can also opt-in to more sophisticated initialization
	///     by implementing overrides to <see cref="ISupportInitialize.BeginInit"/> and
	///     <see cref="ISupportInitialize.EndInit"/> which will be called
	///     when the view is added to a <see cref="SuperView"/>. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///     If first-run-only initialization is preferred, overrides to <see cref="ISupportInitializeNotification"/>
	///     can be implemented, in which case the <see cref="ISupportInitialize"/>
	///     methods will only be called if <see cref="ISupportInitializeNotification.IsInitialized"/>
	///     is <see langword="false"/>. This allows proper <see cref="View"/> inheritance hierarchies
	///     to override base class layout code optimally by doing so only on first run,
	///     instead of on every run.
