    <PackageReleaseNotes>0.80: Jumbo update from BDisp:

* Fixed key events traversal for modal dialogs
* Fixes culture info of DataField from pr
* Fixes the rectangle drawing issue
* Redraw issue when setting coordinates of label
* Added sub menus into menu bar with mouse and key navigation
* Added Colors.Menu.Disabled to CursesDriver.cs
* Mouse text selection with cut, copy and paste on text fields
* Change sepChar from char to string in DateField
* Adding a disabled menu item in the demo file
* Fixes Button repainting issue when changing the text length to one smaller
* Fixes Redraw issue when setting coordinates of label
* Fixes ScrollView does not render some content
* Fixed bug in Button that caused a loop redraw calling TerminalResized
* Fixes a repaint issue (282)
* Mouse features added to FileDialog including wheel support.
* Switch netcoreapp target to netstandard2.0
* Added TextView.TextChanged event
* Fixes issue #306 async/await hang (#312)
* Replaced static driver initialization with property getter for reference passing in Core.cs::View class, this allows the library to be reinitialized at any time.
* Made the Shutdown method on Core.cs::Application class public, since there is no reason to keep it private. Applications can shutdown the library and revert the console to the initial stage by calling it.
* Fixed a memory-leak on Drivers/WindowsDriver class by destroying the generated screen buffers at library shutdown by calling CloseHandle.
* Minor change to Core.cs::Application.Init(Func<Toplevel>) for better initialization status tracking, via backend property instead of relying on the Top field.
* Moved `ListView.ListWrapper` out of `ListView` migueldeicaza/gui.cs#313` (#315)
* Resizing the MessageBox width to accommodate all message text (#299)
* Timefield format with bounds values (#303)
* Implemented lower and upper bounds to TimeField
* Passing old text to the Changed event handler
* Extract methods on ListView to make it controlable from other controls
