    <PackageReleaseNotes>
      This (0.90) is the "Feature Complete" pre-release of Terminal.Gui (aka gui.cs) 1.0. This release is a signficant upgrade from the previous published release (0.81). Most of the major changes and bug fixes are listed below. NOTE: This release includes breaking changes to the API; we will strive to avoid any more breaking changes before 1.0.

      What's new:
      * New sample/demo app - UI Catalog - Replaces demo.cs with an easy to use and extend set of demo scenarios. (Thanks @tig!)
      * The API documentation is completely revamped and updated. Readme upated. Contributors guide added (Thanks @tig!)
      * MenuBar can now have MenuItems directly (enables top-level menu items with no submenu). (Thanks @tig!)
      * API semantics are much more consistent across classes. For example, all events are now defined in terms of event Action instead of EventHanlder. BREAKING CHANGE. (Thanks @bdisp, @worldbeater, and @tig!)
      * The project has been refactored an reorganized to reduce risk of bugs and make it easier to contribute.
      * Symbols are now included with the nuget package.

      Fixes/Improvements (partial list; see Github issues for complete list):
      * Fixes #396 - Text alignnment issues.  (Thanks @tig!)
      * Fixes #423 - Fix putting results of ocgv on command line erases cursor. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Apps can now get KeyUp/KeyDown events. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Example/Designer csproj files updated to latest Visual Studio model. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Adjusted the default colors for Windows to make more readable. (Thanks @tig!)

      * All compile warnings fixed. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Fixed a crash in EnsureVisibleBounds. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Application.Init/Shutdown are more robust. (Thanks @tig!)
      * New "Draw Window Frame" code; consistent across Window, FrameView, and Menu. Fixes many drawing bugs. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Fixes #522 - Last view of Frameview not drawn. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Clipping has been fixed/restored - it now works properly. (#586) (Thanks @tig!)

      * Fixes #557 - MessageBoxes on small screens. (Thanks @tig!)

      * The `MessageBoxes` Scenario in UI Catalog provides a full demo/test-case. (Thanks @tig!)
      * `Dialog` called with `width` and `height` == 0 are sized to 85% container. A new constructor is added making this easy to use. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Dialog (and MessageBox `Buttons` are now dynamically laid out using Computed layout. (Thanks @tig!)
      * A `Dialogs` Scenario has been added to UI Catalog making it easy to test the API. (Thanks @tig!)
      * `Button` now supports BOTH specifying a hotkey with '_' and the old behavior of using the first uppercase char (if '_' is not found). (Thanks @tig!)
      * All UI Catalog scenarios that use `Dialog` or `MessageBox` now use the simplified API. (Thanks @tig!)
      * `Terminal.Gui.dll` now has version metadata and UI Catalog's about box displays it as a test case. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Button, Dialog, and MessageBox API documentation has been updated/revised. (Thanks @tig!)
      * `View`, `Window`, `FrameView`, and `Dialog` have been upgraded to use the new `ConsoleDriver.DrawFrameWindow` API directly. (Thanks @tig!)
      * New ComboBox control (Thanks @fergusonr!)
      * ConsoleDriver now supports improved KeyModifers (shift keys) with an expanded Keys Sceanrio in UI Catalog. (Thanks @bdisp!)

      * Fixes #557 MessageBox needs to take ustrings (BREAKING CHANGE). (Thanks @tig!)

      *   Now supports Computed layout and has constructors that don't require parameters.

      *   ScrollBarViews now correctly position themselves when one, either, or both are on/off.
      *   IsVertical is now a public property that does the expected thing when changed
      *   Mouse handling is better; there's still a bug where the mouse doesn't get grabbed by the ScrollView initially but I think this is a broader problem. I need @BDisp's help on this.
      *   Supports "infinite scrolling" via the new OnDrawContent/DrawContent event on the View class.
      *   The Scrolling Scenario was enhanced to demo dynamically adding/removing horizontal/vertical scrollbars (and to prove it was working right).

      * Fixes #102 All Views now support parameterless constructors. (Thanks @Bdisp and @tig!)

      * Fixes #573 - RadioGroup supports Computed Layout. (Thanks @tig!)
      * RadioGroup now uses a single, good looking, glyph. (Thanks @tig!)
      * RadioGroup now supportrs the Action-based event pattern correctly. BREAKING CHANGE. (Thanks @tig!)
      * ConsoleDriver and Drivers have new standard glyph definitions for things like right arrow. (Thanks @tig!)
      * ScrollView updated to use pretty glyphs. (Thanks @tig!)
      * Menubar now uses pretty arrow glyph for sub-menus. (Thanks @tig!)
      * View now has a Text property, implemented via the new TextFormatting class. (Thanks @tig!)
        * TextAlignment is implemented once across all Views that support it.
        * Unicode support is now much more robust and complete; dozens of bugs fixed.
        * Any view dervied from View now has a Text property with multi-line text formatting, including word-wrap and hotkey support.
        * Label is now mostly just an alias for View; supports Clicked
        * Button is now a very thin class derived from View (no API changes).
        * Dozens of unit tests for TextAlignment are provided reducing the chance of regressions.
      * Fixes #351. Added a horizontal display for RadioGroup. (Thanks @bidsp!)
